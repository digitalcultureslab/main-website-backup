<strong>English 1102.001 (Hybrid Delivery) - Reading Literature and Culture – Douglas College - New Westminster Campus
In-Class Meetings: NWS2680 / Wednesdays - 8:30 - 10:20pm
Dr. David N. Wright / <a href="mailto:wrightd@douglascollege.ca">Email Address</a> 
Office Hours: W: 10:30-11:30 / Office: NWS: 3625 
Phone: 5818 (I rarely check this. <a href="mailto:wrightd@douglascollege.ca">Email me</a> instead)</strong>

In this course, we will examine artistic (primarily literary) representations of digital culture. We'll look at texts that represent coders, hackers, and computers, analyzing how those texts reflect or interpret our digital world. In particular, we'll account for representations that suggest interpretations of digital culture that reflect themes such as fear, the apocalyptic, runaway patriarchy, and unbridled optimism. In short, the course will offer an opportunity to see how artistic production represents the structures of our digital lives. 

As we work to understand representations of digital culture, we'll pay attention to how digital culture reflects social attitudes, cultural practices, and political movements. The aim is to understand how the devices of literary interpretation--character, setting, theme, narrative--can help us dissect the underlying currents of an emerging digital environment.  

The course will be delivered in a hybrid format, meeting once a week and the remainder of the work conducted through on-line resources and this website. The weekly classroom meetings will be conducted as if they were taking place in a lab setting. The classroom is a place for collaboration, implementation, experimentation, execution, and interrogation. It is imperative that you come to class ready to work, having the assigned homework completed and the readings done ahead of time. I will often send announcements through BlackBoard notifying you of new posts, comment threads, and generally reminding you that the course exists. If you do not use BlackBoard, it is your responsibility to keep up-to-date with what’s happening on the website and come to class having done all the required work. 

If you are not using the <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a> browser on your home computer / laptop, please download it for this course. Chrome is a web browser that plays nice with things. You do not need to get / have a google account to download Chrome and you do not need to install it as your “default” browser. You just need it on the machine so I don’t have to remake all the videos. You are welcome to attempt to complete the course on a mobile device. However, there will be occasions when you will need access to the power of a desktop and I make no promises about the mobile compatibility of all the lab exercises. Make sure you can successfully devote 2-3 hours a week to being online with high-speed internet access, either on a desktop, laptop, tablet, or phone.

Please take note of the features and requirements of this course. To complete the requirements for this course, you will need access to a computer with internet on a regular basis. The day that we are not in class should not be considered a day off, but should instead be spent reading, researching, and writing. I will expect that when we meet, you will have a great deal to add to our discussions of the texts.  If you are not a self-motivated student, you may want to consider whether a hybrid class is the right choice for you because this type of course can sometimes be difficult for those who aren’t prepared to take on the responsibility for learning the material on their own time.  You will be expected to do a good deal of learning on your own.  I will guide you, but often, you will be required to find your own way and report your findings.

** A note about the class readings: This course makes extensive use of secondary information that is freely available on the Internet. Links to required readings and other materials will be posted to this website. Please make every effort to do the readings for the class before the class meetings and bring a copy, or a way of reading the novels and/or texts due for the class meetings (paper, tablet, phone, etc.). You will need access to the readings while you are in class. YOU MUST PURCHASE THE TEXTS ABOVE; these novels require a hard copy--paper, digital or otherwise. You can purchase all the books for this course at the Douglas College Bookstore or, using the ISBN numbers above, through another source, like Amazon. If you order a book for the course, please be aware that delivery timelines may not mesh with the course timelines. Make sure you have the book in time for the classes.

Please include your name in the filename (essay1_davidnwright.doc). I will acknowledge the receipt of your essay by Email within 24 hours. If you submit your essay via an Email address other than the one assigned by Douglas College upon your enrollment, please be advised that you may be subject to the terms and conditions of the United States Patriot Act.</li>

<li>You are responsible for reading ALL the readings listed in the course schedule and available through the class website.</li>

	<li>Though not assessed, in-class attendance is required to complete aspects of this course.</li>

<li>Late work will be accepted for 7 days after the due date. <strong>No late work will receive any written comments</strong>. Extensions beyond 7 days or extended absences should be accounted for in person and will require proper substantiating documentation (i.e.: a doctor's note).</li>

<li>Essays and other class assignments cannot be rewritten under any circumstances. <strong>Proper <a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/01/" target="_blank">MLA citation formatting</a> is required for all essays</strong> and essays must be formatted according to MLA citation style. Correct citation, according to the rules of the MLA style guide, is mandatory for all essays. Failure to cite correctly will result in a marked essay with no marginal notes.</li>
 
<li>Missed exams can be re-scheduled in person with the appropriate supporting documentation (I.e. Doctor’s note). Exams cannot be rescheduled for personal reasons, such as travel. Exams cannot be re-written.</li>

<li>You are encouraged to participate fully in the classroom through the use of mobile devices, tablets, laptops, and otherwise. However, please make sure that all audible alerts from these devices are turned off.</li>
 
<li>Though not explicitly stated above, <strong>draft writing is a required element for this course</strong>. Please be sure to make yourself aware of editing session dates and any penalties associated with missing them.</li>

<li>Students who do not submit both essays and complete both exams (70% of the course work) will receive a final grade of UN (unofficial withdrawal) for the course, which will later become an F.</li>

<li>Plagiarism--using the ideas or words of another--a published source, website, chat-room, forum thread, internet portal, social networking site, tutor, or friend--in your writing without proper acknowledgement--is a serious offence that will result in a minimum penalty of an F/0% for the assignment and may result in a note being placed in the student’s file, which could be grounds for expulsion. I will show no pity toward plagiarized papers. Ignorance is not an excuse.</li>

<li>All Douglas College policies apply in this course; in particular, I draw your attention to the <a href="http://www.douglascollege.ca/~/media/1B20B254925B41DD9F93C5B7CAF16700.ashx" target="_blank">Academic Dishonesty policy</a> and the <a href="http://www.douglascollege.ca/~/media/4310D1BD02AE4A74B9D0832D61FA18A1.ashx" target="_blank">User Conduct policy</a>.</li>
</ol>

_____

<strong>Explanations:</strong>

<strong>Essays:</strong> The course will require two take-home formal essays. In order to pass—a grade of P—the course, students must submit both essays. Topics for the essays will be distributed well in advance of the due date. 

Please submit your essays by Email attachment in a compatible .doc file (i.e.: pdf / rtf) format on the due date with your name in the file name (i.e.: essay1_wright.doc). Take-home essays should be typed, double-spaced, in Times New Roman 12pt font, with minimum 1 inch margins and be formatted in MLA style with a title, proper in-text citation and a work(s) cited page.  

For those of you unfamiliar with the requirements of an English course, please remember that good writing is imperative for a positive assessment. Essays should include a relevant thesis statement supported by exposition that is clear and logical. Errors in sentence structure, argumentative logic and grammar, spelling, etc., will affect your grade negatively. Take the time to proof-read your work for typos, formal problems and logic. Keep an extra copy of all essays (except those written in exam booklets). It is your responsibility to provide a copy of your essay—or other work—should it go missing.   

<strong>Exams:</strong> Exams will require a good knowledge of the texts discussed in class and a contextual knowledge of those not directly addressed in the classroom. Questions will be a mix of short answer and essay questions that ask the student to demonstrate an acquired and applied knowledge of the texts and concepts covered in class. In every instance, the emphasis is on the student’s ability to explain clearly and accurately, with a degree of originality, the major concepts of the course.

<strong>Other Assignments:</strong> Explanations and expectations for the other assignments in the course will be included on the assignment sheet. Suffice to say, all the writing, comprehension, and critical thinking skills required for essays and exams will be needed to be successful in these other assignments.

<strong>Ethics Statement:</strong> This course prioritizes the formal requirements of “academic writing” usually understood as proper citation, the logical development of persuasive claims, and a somewhat formal voice. You have an ethical responsibility to write at a level that reflects the absolute best of your abilities in the English language. Remember, your completed essay is a reflection of your effort. Your essays will be graded for the application of course content in the service of making a claim, grammar, vocabulary, argumentation, rhetorical style, organization, and for their attention to the rules of proper academic essay format. All of these components figure equally into your final grade.

<strong>Peer Evaluators / Tutors:</strong> While having others respond to your work outside of class can be helpful, if someone else does more than point out errors and problems and discuss corrections in a general way (if a friend, family member, or an individual solicited on-line rewrites your sentences, adds words that are not your own, or provides you with a thesis or structure for your essay) you are not learning to improve your work. Having others write all or part of your essay or assignments is plagiarism and academic dishonesty. If you are working with a tutor on your essays, you should inform me of that fact and be prepared to submit, if requested, all notes and drafts of your home essays so that I can see what kind of help you have received. Failure to do so will result in an F/0% on the assignment in question. 

<strong>Statement of Responsibilities:</strong> My responsibilities for this course are to introduce a wide range of essay examples and academic writing styles, and to offer strategies for generating, organizing, and writing academic essays. If there is ever something you do not understand, please do not hesitate to raise questions during class. As well, feel free to come and see me during office hours or Email me if you want clarifications, suggestions, or general guidance. However, be prepared with something to talk about, or some general ideas about your problem(s). I will not develop, write, proofread, etc., your paper for you. I encourage you to take advantage of my office hours or Email with questions should you have any problems, but I will not teach the course directly to individuals who do not participate fully in the class. If you cannot make the scheduled office hours, feel free to inquire about making an appointment. 

<strong>Explanation of Grading Procedures:</strong> If you receive a grade you are unhappy with, or do not understand, you should make every effort to come and see me promptly. Do not let grades fester or take on undue gravity. I am more than willing to explain where you went wrong and give you plenty of pointers for improvement. If you do not attend to issues with your writing, you cannot expect to improve. I am never grading your work with an eye for cruelty. I am grading your work in order to show you where you stand amongst students who take—or have taken—an English literature course at Douglas College. As much as possible, try to manage your expectations where grades are concerned. The point of the course is to improve your writing. If your writing did not need improvement, or assessment in a college context, you would not be here. This course is difficult because it demands a level of writing that reflects college and university contexts, not the aptitude of your personal expression or comprehension. In this class, I am grading your writing and how you present the content of your essay.

Because this is a hybrid course, there are some unique requirements. Hopefully, these requirements will be fun to complete and will illuminate the materials for the course. In order to be successful in the course, you will need to commit to, at the barest of minimums, trying. 

<strong>Classroom Meetings</strong>:

As noted in the course outline, "face2face" classroom meetings will be conducted as if they were taking place in a lab setting. When you arrive at class, you should have completed the Homework Lab due for that day. The Homework Labs are designed to be discussed. They need to be attempted and followed through, but they need not be perfect. You need to be able to discuss the contributions you made to the Homework Lab and the outcomes you arrived at -- even if those outcomes are total failure. The point of the lab setting is to create a space where we can discuss limitations, successes, and failures. It is not a space to present perfect work -- leave that for essays. 

You should re-arrange the classroom desks so that you are sitting in groups of four or so (just push them together, removing the chairs that define the lecture-orientation). 

It should go without saying, but you need to have done the reading. All of it. Carefully. Before the class starts. You should arrive at class ready to play. If you are not prepared, I reserve the right to ask you to leave because you cannot possibly contribute to the class without having done any preparatory work. 

<strong>Work Away from Class</strong>

Each week, along with the required reading, you will attempt to complete a lab exercise--or "module." I will introduce the module on the class website--usually the week before we talk about it--and your contribution will consist of a ~350-word "comment" discussing your experience(s) attempting to complete the module.

Each ~350-word "comment" should address some or all of the following:

<ul>
	<li>Reflect on the outcomes of the lab (what did it do for you? how did it help or hinder your understanding of the concepts under discussion for that week? Was it fun? Distracting?) 
<li>Make suggestions about how the lab relates to the text(s) or the concepts (i.e.: setting / character / a theme) under discussion for that week. (what does doing the lab tell us / fail to address / illuminate about the concepts under discussion in the class?)
<li>Record your frustrations (with the platform, the lab itself, the concepts under discussion, or the reading of the text(s))
</ul>

<strong>Remember</strong>: frustration is part of the process here. You should feel free to record your frustrations, successes, highlights, and lowlights. Everything is valid as long as it is thoughtful. You should absolutely avoid writing as if you are reaching for a grade. You are trying to be thoughtful and learn something, not "write for a C."

<strong>Expectations for Work Away From Class</strong>

I expect that you will be spending anywhere from 5-8 hours <em>each week</em> working on the materials for the course outside the face2face classroom setting, either through reading, the Homework Lab, or essay drafting (or all three). If you are doing less than that, you're not meeting the expectations for the class. 

<strong>Conduct</strong>

Whether online or in the classroom, please make every effort to get in there and participate in the class discussions and activities. This class is for you; not me. You will ultimately get out of the class what you put into it. I'm not going to force you to play, but I'm also not going to richly reward sitting out and getting by with the minimum. Finally, please always be mindful of others and their experiences and their unkowns, be respectful, courteous, and positive always. We are trying to find a way forward. ]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome to the virtual space for 1102.001: Reading Literature and Culture. Before we meet in person (or F2F, as the kids say) on Wednesday at the unseemly hour of 8:30am, there are a few things we should get out of the way. 

Below is a list of those things (the bolded titles are links to the pages - click on them!). Make sure you have gone through each item on the list before coming to class on Wednesday morning (really, really, really early in the day. Stupid early). <strong>Before we get to any of this</strong>, if you are using Internet Explorer (Microsoft) to view this website, there are some elements, such as audio and video, that will not display correctly. <strong>I strongly suggest using either <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a> or <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank">Firefox</a>. In fact, if you don't have these browsers installed, please consider downloading and installing them before proceeding</strong>.  

<ul>
<strong><a href="http://digitalcultureslab.ca/hybrid1102/course-outline/">The Course Outline / Syllabus</a></strong> <li>This is the formal agreement between you and me about the rules and requirements for the course. Make sure you come to class with any questions or areas you want me to address.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<strong><a href="http://digitalcultureslab.ca/hybrid1102/course-procedures/">The Course Procedures</a></strong><li>This is an explanation of the course itself and how it will work. Again, take note of any areas you want me to address in person -- if you don't ask about it; I will not address it.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<strong><a href="http://digitalcultureslab.ca/hybrid1102/course-schedule/">The Course Schedule</a></strong><li>This is where you will find the course calendar and schedule -- when stuff is due, what you need to read, what areas we'll be concentrating on, etc. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<strong><a href="https://vimeo.com/115775782" target="_blank">The Course Website Screencast</a></strong><li>This is a video showing you how to register with the class website and get yourself all up and running so that you can participate fully right from the start.</li></ul>

<ul>
<strong><a href="http://digitalcultureslab.ca/hybrid1102/2015/01/01/the-mark-up-module-week-1/">The Mark-Up Module</a></strong><li>This is the first week's module (you'll understand this "module" thing once you've looked at all sections above. Go ahead, be brave. Get started! (It's not due until the Jan. 14th class though)</li></ul>

<strong>Grading Procedures for Modules</strong>

Each module is graded using the criteria below as a guide; one point for fulfilling each criterium. Half marks will be deducted for <em>repeated</em> grammatical errors. (You can make a few mistakes, but the writing should be clear, correct, and understandable.) Modules are due before the class for which they are assigned - no late submissions allowed. 

<ul>
	<li>Worth /1> Depth of response - you are really engaged and reflective about the module's activity</li>
	<li>Worth /1> Indication of relevance to the module's outcomes</li>
	<li>Worth /1> Indication of connection to the text under discussion in class</li>
        <li>Worth /1> Conversation and exchange with your peers - evidence of reading and responding to other comments in the module</li>
	<li>Worth /1>Timeliness (done before Tuesday evening, for instance)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Total /5> Totals will be Emailed to you after every <strong>three modules</strong> and will include: 1) a grade out of 5 for each of the three most recent modules; 2) a running total of the total module grade for the course up to that point.</li>
<li><strong>A missed module results in a grade of 0/5 - this includes missing the module because you did not have the password.</ul>

<h2><strong>OR:</strong></h2>

<strong>The Unessay</strong> (indebted to <a href="http://people.uleth.ca/~daniel.odonnell/author/Daniel+Paul+O%27Donnell/">Daniel Paul O'Donnell</a> who <a href="http://people.uleth.ca/~daniel.odonnell/tag/writing/">came up with it</a> and who I steal from liberally and completely here. The ideas and words below are his)

<strong>Note:</strong> If you choose to do an unessay (awesome!), please <a href="mailto:wrightd@douglascollege.ca">let me know</a>. The above due date holds, but there is flexibility about what you bring to the drafting exercise. 

The essay is a wonderful and flexible tool for engaging with a topic intellectually. It is a very free format that can be turned to discuss any topic--works of literature, of course, but also autobiography, science, entertainment, history, and government, politics, and so on. There is often something provisional about the essay (its name comes from French <em>essai</em>, meaning a trial), and almost always something personal.

The Unessay allows you to:
	<ul><li><a href="#topic">Choose your own topic</a></li>
	<li><a href="#style">Present it any way you please</a></li>
	<li><a href="#grading">Be evaluated on how compelling and effective you are</a></li>
</ul>
	<ul><li><a href="#challenging">Why unessays are not a waste of your time</a></li>
</ul>

Unfortunately, however, as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Essay&amp;oldid=510540710">the Wikipedia notes</a>,
<blockquote>In some countries (e.g., the United States and Canada), essays have become a major part of formal education. Secondary students are taught structured essay formats to improve their writing skills, and admission essays are often used by universities in selecting applicants and, in the humanities and social sciences, as a way of assessing the performance of students during final exams.</blockquote>

One result of this is that the essay form, which should be extremely free and flexible, is instead often presented as a static and rule-bound monster that students must master in order not to lose marks (for a vigorous defence of the flexible essay, see <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/essay.html">software developer Paul Graham’s blog</a>). Far from an opportunity to explore intellectual passions and interests in a personal style, the essay is transformed into a formulaic method for discussing set topics in five paragraphs: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_figures">compulsory figures</a> of academia.

<h4><strong>The Unessay</strong></h4>

The <strong>unessay</strong> is an assignment that attempts to undo the damage done by this approach to teaching writing. It works by throwing out all the rules you have learned about essay writing in the course of your primary, secondary, and post secondary education and asks you to focus instead solely on your intellectual interests and passions. In an unessay you <a href="#topic">choose your own topic</a>, <a href="#style">present it any way you please</a>, and are evaluated on how <a href="#grading">compelling and effective you are</a>.

<h4 id="topic">Choose your own topic</h4>
The unessay allows you to write about anything you want provided you are able to associate your topic with the subject matter of the course and unit we are working on. You can take any approach; you can use as few or as many resources as you wish; you can cite the Wikipedia. The only requirements are that your treatment of the topic be <em>compelling</em>: that is to say presented in a way that leaves the reader thinking that you are being accurate, interesting, and as complete and/or convincing as your subject allows.
<h4 id="style">Present it any way you please</h4>
There are also no formal requirements. Your essay can be written in five paragraphs, or three, or twenty-six. If you decide you need to cite something, you can do that anyway you want. If you want to use lists, use lists. If you want to write in the first person, write in the first person. If you prefer to present the whole thing as a video, present it as a video. Use slang. Or don’t. Write in sentence fragments if you think that would be effective. In other words, in an unessay you have complete freedom of form: you can use whatever style of writing, presentation, citation,… even media you want. What is important is that the format and presentation you do use helps rather than hinders your explanation of the topic.

<h4 id="grading">Be evaluated on how compelling and effective you are</h4>

If unessays can be about anything and there are no restrictions on format and presentation, how are they graded?

The main criteria is how well it all fits together. That is to say, how <em>compelling</em> and <em>effective</em> your work is.

An unessay is <em>compelling</em> when it shows some combination of the following:
<ul>
	<li>it is as interesting as its topic and approach allows</li>
	<li>it is as complete as its topic and approach allows (it doesn’t leave the audience thinking that important points are being skipped over or ignored)</li>
	<li>it is truthful (any questions, evidence, conclusions, or arguments you raise are honestly and accurately presented)</li>
</ul>
In terms of presentation, an unessay is <em>effective</em> when it shows some combination of these attributes:
<ul>
	<li>it is readable/watchable/listenable (i.e. the production values are appropriately high and the audience is not distracted by avoidable lapses in presentation)</li>
	<li>it is appropriate (i.e. it uses a format and medium that suits its topic and approach)</li>
	<li>it is attractive (i.e. it is presented in a way that leads the audience to trust the author and his or her arguments, examples, and conclusions).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="challenging">Why unessays are not a waste of your time</h3>
The unessay may be quite different from what you are used to doing in English class. If so, a reasonable question might be whether I am wasting your time by assigning them. If you can write whatever you want and present it any way you wish, is this not going to be a lot easier to do than an <em>actual</em> essay? And is it not leaving you unprepared for subsequent instructors who want you to right the real kind of essays?

The answer to both these questions is no. Unessays are not going to be easier than “real” essays. There have fewer rules to remember and worry about violating (actually there are none). But unessays are more challenging in that you need to make your own decisions about what you are going to discuss and how you are going to discuss it.

And you are not going to be left unprepared for instructors who assign “real” essays. Questions like how to format your page or prepare a works-cited list are actually quite trivial and easily learned. You can look them up when you need to know them and, increasingly, can get your software to handle these things for you anyway. In our class, moreover, I will be giving you separate instruction on what English professors normally expect to see in the essays you submit to them.

But even more importantly, the things you will be doing in an unessay will help improve your “real” ones: excellent “real” essays also match form to topic and are about things you are interested in; if you learn how to write compelling and effective unessays, you’ll find it a lot easier to do well in your “real” essays as well.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In this course, we will examine artistic (primarily literary) representations of digital culture. We'll look at texts that represent coders, hackers, and computers analyzing how those texts reflect or interpret our digital world. In particular, we'll account for representations that suggest interpretations of digital culture that reflect themes such as fear, the apocalyptic, runaway patriarchy, and unbridled optimism. In short, the course will offer an opportunity to see how artistic production represents the structures of our digital lives.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Instructions:</strong> <em>Due for the Jan. 14th class.</em> This is your first module, so give yourself some time to complete it. You should allow yourself at least an hour, but two would be better. If it goes faster than that, great! But if it's frustrating, you'll have some time to deal with those frustrations.

To complete this module, you will need to go to <a href="http://digitalcultureslab.ca/commentpress/" target="_blank">this place</a> and read the instructions below.

In this module you will be using CommentPress. CommentPress is a little widget that lives inside a website that allows us to "mark-up" text. What we'll be doing is looking in the text for names, places, things, that reference technology in Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore. When you find something, you should identify it, then provide a description or definition of what that place, thing, company, item, person is and how it is related to technology. The daring amongst you can provide a link to an example, picture, or audio / video--whatever. There are instructions about how to use CommentPress on the <a href="http://digitalcultureslab.ca/commentpress/">mark-up website</a> and a screencast video that shows you how it works below. Make sure you read the instructions carefully and watch the video screencast before you go off on your own. 

<center><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/115688604" width="800" height="500" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/115688604">1102 - The Mark-Up Module - Using CommentPress</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user10482230">Digital Cultures Lab</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p></center>

There are three sections to mark-up. One from the very beginning of the book, another from the middle, and finally, one from near the end. The idea is to give you a broad space in which to mark things up; so there should be plenty for everyone to contribute to. If you find someone has found a reference that you want to add something too, feel free. This is an exercise in exchange. We should all be working together to illuminate the text in an interesting way. 

<strong>Summary:</strong> 

<strong>Task:</strong> identify words / phrases / references to technology in any section of Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore on the class CommentPress site.

<strong>How many words / phrases / references should I identify?</strong> 
<ul><li>Try for at least 5, but do as many as you like. If you find someone has done everything, then add some comments to what's already been found. But trust me, no one can find them all. Look around!</li></ul>

<strong>Outcomes</strong>: 
<ul><li>How does marking-up / tagging / identifying technological things in the text help us understand setting and the role it plays in the novel?</li>
	<li>How does the process of marking-up the text make interpreting the deeper meaning of the text easier / harder?</li>
	<li>How is the setting essential to understanding the novel and its broader point about the relationship between old and new knowledge?</li></ul>
 
<strong>Takeaways</strong>:
<ul><li>The text assumes an audience familiar with certain elements of reality. We know this because of the marking-up of words in the text.</li>
	<li>Writing does not exist in a vacuum. Would your grandmother understand this novel, with all its references to technology?</li>
	<li>Who is the audience for this novel? Is that audience reflected in the book's main characters?</li>
	<li>What did you think of the CommentPress platform? Was it helpful in completing the task? How so or how not?</li></ul>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Identifying technological things in the text allows for readers to understand when the story is taking place. The reader may be able to gauge what time period/era the story is taking place in by the pieces of technology described. The references may act as markers in time that the reader would recognize and place relative to themselves. By defining the time period, the reader may understand the importance of that piece of technology to the characters and their society. 

The setting is essential to understanding the novel because we can grasp the significance of a major conflict. Because the story takes place in modern time, readers can easily relate to the story’s conflict of rapid change from books to computers. 

Unfortunately, my grandmother would not understand this novel’s technological references. She, I would say, does not fall into the targeted audience of the book. I would say the book’s main audience is people approximately aged 15-35 years old. The targeted audience is reflected in the book, as the main characters would fall into the targeted age categories themselves. Clay, Kat and Neel are all young adults who are thoroughly ‘tech savvy’. 

I think CommentPress is a really cool learning tool and discussion platform. I like how some comments gave a mini history of the references that I would have otherwise not have known and they made me realize just how much technology is a part of my life. While reading those excerpts for the first time, I hardly noticed how many references litter the pages. The comments really highlighted how much technology is integrated seamlessly in the book as well as in my own life.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The lab allowed me to learn more about the actual definitions of today's digital terms. It was actually fun going through the three chapters and spotting for internet or computer related words, it was like looking for Waldo or something. I mean, it was time consuming with finding the definitions, then coming up with your own definitions were tedious, but it was fun looking for gifs. Although it took a long time, it actually helped me understand more about the discussion this week ( setting and context). We are set into Clay's mind where he is very familiar with almost everything that computers offer us today: too much data, pirate libraries, hacking missions, reliable information that can be considered as illegal things. This lab describes the wide expense that computer brings into the the novel, aside from the fact that computers correlate with books, random but cool in its unexpected way.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Nice work Paula, glad you found it useful. You might think about how the book plays on traditional genres (another term will be dissecting in class): it's part detective novel, part quest, part love story, part science fiction. Think about how it employs the devices you expect from fiction-writing. How does it play off your expectations? (You don't have to answer now, just think about it.)

Also, where are the GIFs? I'm excited for the GIFs...]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for this Maxine. You might press a little more on what you mean by "setting is essential to understanding the novel because we can grasp the significance of major conflict." What is the conflict? Between what and what? How is that important for "understanding" -- what are we trying to "understand"? 

All this to point out that by contextualizing your thinking in terms of "because the story takes place in modern time [sic]" you are restricting your thinking and writing. The interpretation you might offer need not have anything to do with when the book was written. Instead, take the book on its own terms. What's the conflict in the book? How does that conflict REFLECT our current situation; not how does our current situation help us understand things in the book.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Marking up/tagging/identifying the technological phrases and words helps us to understand the age in which the book was written and to figure out whom the author directed this novel towards. The identification of these terms helps us to understand that the novel is directed towards those who were born in and have lived through the more resent technological age of computers and internet devices. The recognition of terms and phrases pertaining to the theme of technology helps to make an easier and deeper interpretation of the text because there is further analysis of the text. 
The setting of the story is essential to the understanding of the novel because it sets the theme of the conflict in the story, which is the old verse the new. The old refers to the older styles of gathering information and preforming hobbies, such as reading, to new ways of getting information and preforming hobbies.
My Grandmas on either side of my family, are both very different. One would understand all the references in this book, and the other would not, she would need an explanation of most of the terms. The audience of this book are those who are under 40 or those who have adopted the technology as it has evolved. The characters in this book are very reflective of the technology age with the description of the items they use, along with their perspective of the world and the use of old knowledge and new knowledge. 
The CommentPress platform is good for being able to view the text and analyze it by each chapter and paragraph. It is really good to be able to comment and gather other student’s opinions in one area where it is open for review and discussion. It was helpful to complete the task of identifying terms and phrases because with a book there is not necessarily enough room to write down the words or identify them all. With identifying the terms and phrases there would be a high use of sticky notes and a highlighter which would not be ideal for rereading the book.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[At first, I took the tagging exercise lightly. But after having thought of the number of technological terms in the text, it illuminated something I did not realize initially. In the beginning of the text, there seems to be a constant conflict between old knowledge—books and new knowledge—computers. This is marked by the constant contemplation of Clay as to why the bookstore's customer keep coming back for "old" books way before Clay was even born. Then I realized both generation's perspectives of gathering information. Clay which represents the computer-age generation who look down on people who read books and think of them as boring and old-fashioned. While on the other hand, Mr. Penumbra's boss, Corvina, think down on computer-age generations who regard them as tradition breakers. But later on towards the middle of the text, both generations close the distance and both are engaged in one another's fashion: integrating the new with the old and the old with the new. That is to say, books and computers and computers and books.

With all the technological terms contained within the text, the book is mainly focused on computer literate people. If my grandparents are to read this book, I am pretty certain I would have the pleasure of witnessing their contorted faces trying to make meaning of what they come across with. Not that it would be a polite and appropriate thing to do, but I can just picture that in my mind. 
Since the book is mainly focused on Clay's perspective, who is a computer savvy, I think that the book itself is an encouragement to explore past generations because the older generation is not boring, that they have their interesting stories to tell as well.

I hope I am doing this right. My mind is still on vacation mode. 

Cheers.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[You're doing it correctly. Some interesting thoughts here, especially in the first paragraph. Watch that you don't get side-tracked by the "grandmother" perspective. While it's important to get your head around how other readers might encounter the book, it's also important to think about that conflict you identify between old and new / books and computers. If you've read to the end, you know that it's decidedly analogue. So, despite the book's voluminous references to technology, think about what final statement the book makes... how does the book feel about books?]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Good stuff Natasha. You might think about the differences in "tagging" a book using sticky notes and CommentPress. How is one different than the other, not just that it's different, but *how* is it different? You seem to suggest that marking up the book, for instance, inhibits re-reading. Why? And how does it do this? One way might be that it "pre-interprets" the book for the next reader or for you re-reading, with the notes and highlighter markings suggesting that there's only one way to (or there's a "correct" way to) read / interpret the text. Marking up the text by hand then limits the interpretive possibilities that CommentPress--which doesn't touch the book--allows.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Due to its simplistic setup, my first experience using the Comment Press platform turned out to be quite enjoyable. The overall task was easy to understand, however looking back I realized I submitted a word that did not correspond to the paragraph I was tagging (whoops!).
By identifying technological references, this task helps by developing the setting. The various references to tech-savvy vocabulary makes it evident that the story is taking place during a time when new technology, modern gadgets and the internet are starting to replace traditional practices, therefore becoming a reason for conflict between parties with opposing views. The contrast between Clay’s views on new technology is evidently different than those of Mr. Corvina, a clear example of a situation that is present in today’s society as well. In addition to the multiple technological references mentioned in the novel, the detailed descriptions regarding modern high-tech procedures provided me with a new perspective on the complexity associated with computer programming and all things technology.
In regards to the references made to technology, I highly doubt my grandparents would understand any of them, perhaps with the exception of ‘internet’. Nonetheless, even I had some difficulty understanding what I consider to be more ‘advanced’ technological words such as ‘Ruby’ and the other programming languages mentioned by Clay. 
Clay, like many young people today, is well-informed of modern technological advancements and considers them to be beneficial for society.  Even though he knows far more than I do, Clay still experiences situations during which he feels his knowledge and talent regarding technology is not up to par with his peers. In my opinion, this makes the audience relate to him more as many of us go through the same struggle at times. Regardless, Clay represents an individual with a personality and perspective not too different from many young adults in today’s day and age. It seems as if he appreciates technology as a method of advancement and improving day to day life, however, I’m not sure if he’s willing to give up a traditional book for a Kindle.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The CommentPress platform was easy to understand and helped complete the task easily. It was helpful in identifying some words that we may not have noticed or did not understand the meaning of due to other people having marked-up the word.

Marking-up/tagging allows us to understand the setting of the novel, from a high tech person’s point of view. By marking-up up the text I was able to better understand the sentences in the text, as there were some words in the text that even I was not aware of such as “time-series visualization”. So if the three texts had reoccurring words, due to them being marked-up one can know the meaning of the following sentences. Therefore making it easier for the reader to understand the setting and deeper meaning of the texts.

The setting of novel helps the reader understand of the border separating the old knowledge and new knowledge. In the novel the old knowledge does not wish to adopt the ways of the new knowledge, and the new knowledge believe that they have the answer to all solutions. So they both only acknowledge each other but do not wish to combine the knowledge they both hold to find the solution. Clay helps us identify a way where both the old knowledge and new knowledge can work side by side to solve a puzzle that could not be solved with just the old knowledge or new knowledge.

My grandmother would be able to understand the basic and simple references to technology that the novel was making such as a laptop. However, she would not be able to understand most of the vocabulary in the novel, as she was not raised in an environment that had lots of technology. Therefore, she would most likely not be within the age range for the audience of the novel. The audience of the novel would mostly consist of young adults who are aware of most of the references to the high tech things in the novel.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The text assumes multiple things that are familiar with the audience: the concepts of a laptop, everyone in the possession of a phone, social media (Twitter, facebook), huge internet based corporations such as Google, as-well as future developments such as a self-driving car. So it is safe to assume the audience that this text is targeting is perhaps from 13-40 or so. 
Older individuals would not understand the references made (Such as my grandmother). Concepts such as a mobile phone, Google, social media and a self-driving car would make absolutely no sense to my grandmother and many other seniors in that generation. Such a distinction between generations and technology is evident in Mr. Penumbra’s lack of tech-savvy language (Calling a mac a make and model, as if it was a car) and Marcus Corvina’s strong resistance towards technology in general. 

It was evident that clay was dealing with two very different groups of people - symbolizing conflict between technology and older “ways” in clays dialogue. Clay regularly pointed out how the Company owned by Corvina was tech-savvy when it came to business, but backwards when it came to the reading room. There would be very technological savvy locations Clay would find himself in (such as the google campus) and then suddenly Clay would find himself back in Mr.Penumbras book store, or the reading room which forbid technology, including phones.
The main characters, in many ways do represent the target audience. The main characters were all quite young, with the exception of Mr.Penumbra. Mat seems to be a middle ground between the integration of technology completely over old ways and keeping with the past. Clay’s narrative demonstrated this fact as he stated Mat was a dying breed of sorts of special effects artists who work with physical materials over digital effects. Neel and Kat were both quite savvy, as well as the main character Clay. 
I think the comment platform is very interesting because it can provide a new perspective on a problem. Such as someone seeing meaning something I didn’t catch or may have missed, or provide their interpretation of the text. Reading the comments others left was helpful, especially if you seem fixated on a single idea, the comments of others may help to broaden the scope.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The setting of this book is inside Clays mind, viewing the world under his filter. Throughout the novel, Clay finds that he can solve the riddle of the Manutius book by using all his resources, old knowledge and new knowledge. He does this by using Google, programming software, coded books, and elderly advice. If the setting were in someone else’s point of view, the novel would be written differently. The mindset of Corvina would result in a novel with no mention of using new knowledge to solve the code because he believes that technology can’t solve a man made riddle. In total, the deeper meaning of the novel is that there should not be a debate of whether old knowledge is more important than new knowledge, but both have their strengths and weaknesses so together they can provide an all around solid source of information. Hard copy books are easier to navigate and have infinite battery life, but Kindles are lighter and carry more novels. The characters that were focusing solely on technology to solve the code (Kat) came to a dead end and the characters that were using only old books to solve the code (Corvina) were not successful either. It was essential that the setting be in the mind of the one who solved the code to show how to incorporate both old knowledge and new knowledge into our lives.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The setting is taking place inside Clay Jannon's mind, which gives us a very one sided view to what is happening in the novel. Marking-up the text and looking for technological references helps show us the time of when the book was based and where it occurs. The technology advancements that we see at google is a large contrast as to the technology used with the unbroken spine. This acts as a foil in the novel and helps create a more clear conflict in the novel. Google is seen as the new knowledge since we use all the new technology to determine the new technology, whereas the Unbroken Spine doesn't use any technology and only refers to books to find new information therefor making this the old knowledge. The Old versus New Knowledge creates another conflict throughout the story and is one of the main ones, that helps Penumbra solve what the Codex Vitae means. No one was able to solve the Codex Vitae only using one form of knowledge but instead used both old and new knowledge to solve the hidden message. It was important to the setting that it was portrayed through Clay's mind since he was always using both old and new knowledge to solve his problems. If the setting had been in the mind of one of the other characters it would of been written very differently since most other characters only used Old or New knowledge and never combined the two, which is why it was only Clay that could solve Manutius.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Good comments here Rachel. Try to work through them a little further; this reads like you are listing things without really thinking about how things might combine or reflect one another (it reads like you are writing for me, making sure that you show me you notice what I think you should notice). So, you've covered all the basics and have a good sense of the plot, but what does all this mean? Why is it important? What makes it significant? Why even write / read a book like this? What might it tell us about the state of our current context? Push a little harder and goods critical thinking will emerge.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Nice work Ashley. What does this all say about how we see books functioning in today's world? Do you think you will ever accumulate a physical "library" of books that you own or will they all be online? And, how is reading different on paper as opposed to through a Kindle or the like? What we need to think about is how <em>Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore</em> prioritizes one type of knowledge over another--assuming it does. What might the novel be suggesting about the importance of books as physical objects?]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Great Arman. You've certainly got the conflict down. Think about how what the text assumes--as you note in the first paragraph--affects your reading of that conflict. How is the conflict informed by the technological references you understand or how is the book itself a kind of codex for someone who doesn't get the technological references. Would a reader need to "decode" the textual reference to technology in order to understand it? Why or why not? And, what does that mean for the book itself--is <em>Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore</em> a codex vitae?]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I found that the Comment Press platform was very helpful with analyzing the text. The amount of comments within the text about technology highlighted the importance of technology within the book. 
All throughout the book the text explains the constant battle between technology and books. The setting is thoroughly established through this conflict of the new age and old age of technology. Clay, the main character throughout this book, finds himself working in an old bookstore. This is ironic because Clay is very involved with computers and technology himself and finds that the bookstore is his polar opposite. The book develops this conflict of technology and books through Old Knowledge and computers, which also establishes the setting of the book and the time frame that the book may take place in. As a result of the OK and the TK conflict, the time frame may be where technology is greatly integrated within the generation and is proven in the book through the large involvement of google.
The marking up of the text made the interpreting the deeper meaning of the text much easier. The significant amount of technology vocabulary made it clear where the conflict resides in. Marking up the text individually really helped me engage into the book and start thinking more critically about the conflict. 
The setting is essential to understanding the novel and its broader point about the relationships between old and new knowledge. This book can definitely relate to our culture today where our older generations are not as technologically evolved the younger generation. Some people that live within the older generation of books and old knowledge are finding it more difficult to adapt just as Mr. Corvina in the book. Other people within the older generation may be struggling but open to the new technology age just like Mr. Penumbra. Finally the new and younger generation that is more technologically engaged may relate to Clay and Kat as they are both accustomed and comfortable with technology.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[When I was identifying technological things in CommentPress for this novel, it reminded me of technological things people nowadays are so accustomed to. For example, you see words such as Google, laptop, or internet in CommentPress. It helps me understand the importance that technology plays in the novel and in our own world. In comparison to old knowledge, current technology is a vital aspect in our day-to-day lives. We use technology to pay our bills, entertain ourselves, or do general research. In this novel, Clay’s group uses technology to decrypt the book of Manutius. Technology is a centerpiece in the story. 
My grandmother would not understand the references to technology. When I look at it from this perspective, the old world does not mesh with the new technology. Furthermore, the technology that exists today would only be considered a dream in her childhood. Just a few weeks ago I had to teach an elderly in my extended family how to use a laptop. It was very difficult to teach because in their view technology is too complicated nowadays. On a side note, they referred to a computer mouse as “the little guy”.    
Using CommentPress was something very new to me. In fact, this class would be considered my first partial online course. Using Blackboard and CommentPress are all new learning experiences for me. I was confused on how to use CommentPress in the beginning because I could not find where the 3 sections were located. After about 20 minutes, I realized you had to click on navigate to see the 3 sections. CommentPress was helpful in the sense that it showed words of new technology in the novel’s text. Once I found the 3 sections, I took my time reading over the texts and looking for key technological words to comment on. Most words were commented on by other classmates, so I tried my best to find paragraphs with 0 comments to write on. CommentPress seems like a useful tool to keep us engaged in the novel we are reading on certain weeks. The learning process is always important in the first week!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Identifying technological references help readers to understand the role it plays in the novel. These references serve a purpose for character development, for example, Clay uses wifi, 3d scanner, google, etc. and it shows that Clay (and all other young characters like Kat, Neel and Mat) are computer savvy and the new generation. It also helps readers to distinguish between  the new generation and the previous generation. Clay is the new generation because he is using new technology to gain knowledge. In contrast, Corvina is the old generation because he is using books in order to find information. Both characters are very different because Corvina rejects technology as a way to find information because it lacks traditional knowledge while Clay utilizes technology because getting information is quick and easy. Moreover, Mr. Penumbra is between the new and old generation because he bought a new Mac and learning how to use it (transitioning from books to technology to find information). 

This task also help readers to relate themselves to the characters and understand the characters better. We can relate to these words easily because we are all familiar with words like google, twitter, Facebook and we use technology for the same reason as the characters.

The audience for this novel is for those who grew up with technology because the audience can understand the technological references in the novel and they can also relate to the book’s main characters. My grandmother would not understand this book because she is not exposed enough to technology to understand the references.

I think CommentPress is cool way to discuss more about the book about its theme, characters, conflict between books and technology and apply that to outside of the novel. 
But for the task, defining terms is frustrating for me. It is hard to define technological terms because we/younger generation do not need to know the exact definitions since we grew up with it and its there for us already. That also made me realize how much we rely on technology.

I hope I’m doing this right as I am still in holiday mode.
Thanks!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The setting is in Clay Jannon’s mind; however, the audience is us, or a small to large group of people that are not able to critique Clay right away. Most people are more willing to convey their thoughts when an opinion is not voiced, such as Clay can voice his thoughts to the audience without the risk of criticism, just how we can voice our opinions on Commentpress compared to how quiet we were in our first literature class. Most people do not want to make errors, like myself, and lower the chances of making errors by not talking or voicing their answers in class to receive instant critique or praise. Clay is the same, is not afraid to narrate his thoughts to the audience, even about a “beautiful late-night hacker girl” (The Prototype 31).  I found this Commentpress assignment interesting because it got people to type and identify words that referred to technology. But what was really intriguing to me was that people often identified words that our parents would not understand, but not words that they would understand. The assignment “identify words / phrases / references to technology in any section of Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore on the class CommentPress site” means exactly what it is. At first, I did not look at it and read the book as it is, but as I attempted to complete the assignment, I was astonished on how many words and references I missed such as Google, craigslist, and scanner I understood them by second nature. I treated them like any other word. Then I noticed I missed noticing words such as “lights”(The Prototype 62), “a piece of music”(64), and “bell tinkl[ing]”(Help Wanted 23) which would complete the assignment requirements just fine. Then I noticed in CommentPress that many people defined the words such as “laptop”(Help Wanted 5, The prototype 12, 41, The rebel alliance 24, 61) many times, instead of simple technologies such as a “ladder”(Help Wanted 1). Then I realized we, society, are losing our definition of what technology is, we are taking technology for granted, and we, the class, are demonstrating it by losing our touch with what we do have. Every time a new Iphone comes out, we disregard the old version for a new one, and expect more and more. Overall, I feel Commentpress can aid us in future projects such as it did for me for this one.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The lab is a good learning tool as it helps learn about the exact meaning of some technology and computer terms. For example, I know that C is a computer language, but I don’t know what is about or how it works so searching the meaning helps to know more about terms. Besides, using all these technological terms and phrases are helping identify the sitting of the story that takes place in time reading traditions and customs started to change.  The differences between Clay’s methods and Mr. Penumbra reflect partly the debate about if we should keep the books or we should shift to eBooks and googling any needed information. Another important idea of this novel is that we can use new technology to read and understand books much easier and faster. However, the end of the story proves that old knowledge and new knowledge can work together in harmony as an old mastery started in old books and solved by new computer programs. Furthermore, the relationship between Clay and Mr. Penumbra reflects that the liaison between old and new knowledge could be on and off, but they can work   together to produce something significant. Indeed, new knowledge was extended from old one that started in papers and books; therefore, we can merge them without replacing one by another because the papers still have a lot to offer and a lot of knowledge could be discovered.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The incorporation of technological things within the text is important because it enables readers to envision the setting within the story line of the novel. The setting is described through the perspective of the novel’s main character, Clay. By identifying the setting, readers are able to better understand the major conflict within the novel, which involves new electronic technology (e.g. computers) versus old fashioned ways of gathering information (e.g. books).  

The audience for this novel is for those who grew up in the technology era where technology is a big component of school related, work related, and leisure activities. The story may correspond well to young adults as well as older generations who have kept up to date with modern technology. 

Clay’s character is a clear representation of the novel’s targeted audience because he is tech savvy and does not initially acknowledge the benefits of old fashioned print books at the start of the novel.  in contrast to Clay’s character, the novel introduces Corvina, who is set on old fashioned books and ways. As the story progress the readers learn that certain characters of the story become more open to incorporating old and new technology in order to successfully decode the Codex Vitae. 

Because the novel has many references to modern technology, I don’t believe my grandmother would be able to understand this novel. Without any background knowledge regarding modern technology, one might have trouble understanding the characters, context, and story line of the novel. For example the novel makes references to Apple, Macs, kindle, and even Google, which is modern technology  that my grandmother would not understand.

The CommentPress platform was helpful because it lets you read more in depth as you analyze and interpret the text. The task to analyze technological terms helps show the importance of technology with reference to the novel. CommentPress is helpful because it allows you to see how other readers interpreted the text. The CommentPress platform was also simple to understand and easy to use.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[By identifying the various technological terms in the text, I got a true understanding of how significant of role setting plays in this novel. Having the setting in Clay’s mind we see his savvy knowledge in various technological items. We also see how the society around him is transitioning from old to new knowledge with technology. The numerous references of technological items helps the reader understand how the younger generation with Clay, Kat, and Neel contrast from the older generation of Corvina and the Unbroken Spine. Ultimately, both sides are decrypting the book of Manutius, but Clay’s use of both old and mainly new knowledge shows how more efficient and effective his methods were in solving the puzzle compared the old generation. We can truly see the impact of new knowledge in the story with all the technological terms such as prototype, hacking, visualization, etc and how it took so little time to solve a 500 year mystery. These words give the reader the true perspective of Clay’s “new knowledge” mind and is something younger generations such as myself can relate to.

With the assortment of technological terms throughout the novel we can see the main audience of the story to be of one familiar with new technology (new knowledge). Being a person growing up in such technologically minded society I can relate well to Clay and his mission to solve the Manutius. Even other characters such as Kat were relatable especially for technologically advanced audiences. Someone such as my grandmother would not understand the references to technology and not be able to connect to the book the same way I do. She would more likely prefer to read a book from Corvina’s perspective (old knowledge).

Using CommentPress was very simple and easy to use. It was a great way to truly see the many technological terms that were used in the story. It really gave me the significance the new knowledge had in the setting of the story and ultimately why I felt I related well to Clay. I found using the CommentPress was a great “new knowledge” technique to help me grasp the significance of setting in this novel.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The CommentPress platform is amazing and incredible tool. When I opened it, there are 3 themes the same as the paperbook. There is number in front of each sentence to convert a title. Computer software can display a whole book on screen of a device such as Kindle. I can read them online or download from Kindle or iBook’s into technological products such iPhone, Taplet, laptop and so on. I have never known about the Kindle until I read through the Mr. Penumbra’s 24 hour bookstore book. Paper books or e-books help people to learn about new technology.  The CommentPress helps me to understand the context, word phrases, and concepts of the novel shared by network technology. Also, new technology allows me to add my ideas and read through their comments using computer technology. All messages are immediately send out by high tech tools.

I think my grandmother will be able to know the novel because we are using new technologies to help her. If she does not understand abbreviated words and context of sentences, she can Google it. New technologies are easier to find out from the network rather than flip over some book searching for all the references. She might not know some computer terms but she can popularly understand what the story is from the book. For example, there is an old message hidden in the book from the five hundred year ago. Some readers tried to use computer technologies and power to decode the message but none of them could find out the secret of society. In the book, the main character Clay Jannon found the secret without computer technologies. 

In my opinion, the book is very interesting and exciting for different types of readers. Videogames always attract a lot of teenagers and adolescences to play like Grumble character in the book. For instance, even though Mr. Panumbra has a lot of knowledge in his brain, he try to use computer technologies to solve the five hundred year old puzzle. Eventually, he could not figure it out. I think the main audience can be young people and adults like Clay Jannon. Clay Jannon used his talent and patience to solve the puzzle without using computer.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[At first, I assumed that the main audience of Mr. Penumbras 24-Hour Bookstore were teenagers and young adults due to the many references to technology and the internet. Clayton even bluntly states that any person over 30 would find his technological terms difficult to understand.  However, I soon discovered that with the exception of several young main characters (Kat, Neel, and Clay) the book revolved around many elderly people as well. It frequently empathized Penumbra’s wish for the integration of computers into the Unbroken Spine. This surprised me because most of the elderly people that I know do not feel that way. They believe that although technology has many positive outcomes, getting to an answer quicker only makes us more impatient. My grandparents, for example, would not be able to relate to Penumbra but instead more closely to Corvina, though not quite as severe and intense. They stubbornly believe in “the old-fashioned way” and have made little effort in learning how more advanced technology works. If they were to read the novel, maybe their opinions would differ slightly!

 Even my parents, when reading this book, may not be able to take as much from the text as younger people would. They would relate more to the “old knowledge” found in this book such as getting to an answer through reading and working for it. The “new knowledge”, however, I can relate to in a sense that the most efficient and quickest way to solve a problem should be the method used most prominently.

The "marking-up" module for this novel has been great motivation to pay more attention when reading Mr. Penumbra 24-Hour Bookstore. I thought at first that it would be difficult and distracting to be thinking of references to technology while reading, but it proved easier than suspected. When technology came up in the text, I was quick to refer back to the assignment and consider the context in which the technological reference has been given. I liked the process because it forced me to think more about what I was reading and absorb the information.  However, there were several times where I would go several pages without stopping before realizing I had skipped numerous technological references. These were areas that were exciting and sucked me right into the book. I had to go back and re-read the pages more carefully.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Marking up or “tagging” in this week’s module was a great method to help emphasize the role of technology in Mr. Penumbra’s 24 Hour Bookstore. The period of time in which I grew up happened to be amongst a huge technological revolution. Having that said, marking up the meanings of these different innovations and diving deeper into the meanings of them made me realize how much I have overlooked them in the past since they were terms I grew up using. The setting is essential in our understanding of old and new knowledge because at many points throughout the novel, we are presented with antagonistic means of how things used to be done versus how they are done, in a more efficient manner in present time. Similarly, as Dave mentioned in our class last week, we were reading a “book about books”, which made me make the connection of the significance of the old knowledge coming from the books in Mr. Penumbra’s bookstore over the new knowledge that can be seen in books today, such as this and through technological mediums. Although, that it may seem like old knowledge and new knowledge are opposing forces, if there was not old knowledge it would surely not have led to new. 

Evidently, my grandmother would not be familiar with much of this novel if any. The main targeted audience are those that grew up around the nineties to the early 2000’s, and are the same people that heavily rely on social media, cell phones, and new knowledge in their everyday lives. 
With the use of Clay Jannon and Kat to demonstrate new knowledge, and Mr. Penumbra to demonstrate old knowledge, the audience was able to grasp the concept of the effects of technology in the 21st century. 

The CommentPress platform was fun to use! Unique to any assignment I have ever completed, it enabled me to be more aware and focused of what I am reading.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Marking up, tagging, and identifying technology in the text helps us to picture and get a feel of the time period of the story. There are many words in the book that refer to common technology in this day and age which shows how significant the role of technology is to the book. The book is centered around electronic devices and hacking.

My grandmother would definitely not understand the terms referring to technology. Technology has grown and developed so much that my grandmother is most likely too old to know what these terms mean except for the “phone”. The main audience for this book is probably young men and women who are familiar with these terms and references. The book does reflect this age group because most of these characters are young men and women probably in there 20s. 

The CommentPress platform was interesting to use as I have never used it before. It was pretty simple and straightforward to use and I saw it as a creative way to help make the book mean something. It was helpful in completing the task because of the easiness of simply commenting and the ability to see what other people commented is interactive. 

The lab was helpful, it allowed me to read over parts of what I read previously and understand them better. It wasn't all that hard and it was interesting using a new platform that I haven't used before. It was a struggle to make the book mean something, but after looking for terms and describing them and seeing what other people commented and tagged, it helped me understand the book and its value a little more.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Tagging technological things in the text was definitely an eye opener for me. It became obvious that a lot of technology is used in this novel but it wasn't as blatant the first time I read through on my own. Going through and marking up technological terms made me realize I am so used to seeing and interacting with technology in my daily life that when it came down to defining something simple I really had to think about a formal definition. I liked that tagging certain paragraphs also clarified what some of the terms were. Personally, I am not tech savvy at all so seeing others define and clarify some of the terminology and references was really helpful. 

The process of marking-up the text make interpreting the deeper meaning of the text easier in some ways and harder in others. For example, some basic terminology such as 'code' is commonly understood yet when coming up with a way to describe it can be challenging. It made me aware of the fact that some things that seem basic and simple at first can actually be complex without initially realizing. A way that I found tagging made the text easier to understand was having help from classmates and the clarification of more technological terms. 

I find the comment press to be a really helpful tool so far. I appreciate that we can all share our opinions and get insight if we are stuck or offer if to others who might be frustrated or confused as well.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The lab for me was a good tool as it made me pay more attention to certain things, aspects, or point of views. When we had to do the tagging/mark up on CommentPress it made me focus on phrases that included technological aspects. Reading through everyone’s comments made me realize how technology impacts everyone’s life, what they use it for, and how they all describe it differently. Reading through those three chapters that were given on CommentPress I didn’t even realize how much technology was is intergraded throughout the text.  The tagging module was really cool, I’ve never done anything like this but it helped me understand the context/setting of the novel.

We are the audience for this novel but the theme/setting takes place alone in Clays head. We can all relate to what was going on in Clays mind that there is just too much technology everywhere we look.

Its amazing to me how much our generation is accustomed and attached to technology. We rely on it for so many things but I think we forget the dangers of it too. When I first began to read this novel I just imagined having a local bookstore like that around here. Sure, you can go to the local library or and purchase a book. But, I find it neat how with every novel bought or sold back has such a history behind it. Clay gets the coolest perspective, and although it may not emphasize it in the book you can make your own inferences about how cool it would be to see all different kinds of people, from all different walks of life come in and somehow have something in common. In today’s day and age, I think it’s quite sad how we don’t have much of anything like that, I mean all the reading someone may need is available on the computer or their phones.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The tagging/ marking-up process helped us interpret the context of the book. Nowadays, many of us read over commonly used technology words such as internet, laptop or Google and typically will not think about the meaning of the word in the context it is in. We are the generation where this vocabulary is common knowledge to us but we will all benefit from finding the deeper meaning and reading more than one definition of a technological term. The Comment Press platform also emphasized one of the main themes in the novel: technology.  

People in earlier generations such our grandparents and even our parents would have difficulties decoding the vocabulary in Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore since they grew up in a time where they were not surrounded by technology. The intended audience of Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore is for those who are 14 - 40. They would have background knowledge on the vocabulary used throughout the book and that way be able to understand the message. The majority of the characters were young and tech savy so the audience certainly does reflect on the main characters. 

The setting takes place in Clay’s mind where he used Old Knowledge and New Knowledge to solve the puzzle. At the beginning, both Penumbra and Clay were stuck in their ways so to say and did not want to collaborate and teach each about old and new knowledge. The booked continued to jump from old to new knowledge. For instance, Clay toured through Google then not long after he ended up back working in the book store. In the end, Clay discovered a way to combine the old knowledge with the new thus, solving the conflict. The novel would have been completely different if it was told from a different characters’ perspective since none of the others used both old knowledge and new knowledge (Penumbra uses old and Kat, Neel, and Matt all use new).]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I found comment press has a very simple design and is very easy to use.  This made this week’s module quite pleasant to complete. However in terms of making the text easier for me to process it has not made a real difference, mainly because 95 percent of the terms I had already understood what they were. That being said after doing this module and paying closer attention to all the technology terms used in the book it is easy to see how another person could get lost in the language. A few things that this module does do though, is it helps the reader understand when this book was written, who the target audience is and where this book takes place. Based on the amount of technological terms it becomes quite evident that this book is directed towards a younger demographic. It also helps determine when and where this book takes place, for example the first kindle had not come out 10 years ago. Which makes it obvious the book was based in the last few years. 

It is important to understand setting because it can help the readers appreciate the relationship between old and new knowledge. This is because the majority of the setting is within Clay’s mind and he is the link between old and new knowledge. There is the representation of old knowledge that is Marcus, and on the other side of the spectrum there is Neel who represents the new knowledge. Marcus who wishes to stay clear from computers is much unlike Neel who is a computer animator. Both of these characters do having something in common though and that is Clay. Clay unites the two sides and is willing to use any resource he has available to him, in order to crack the codex vitae. Whether that be using computers to crack the codes or paying closer attention to a book he once read, he and Ajax or the true links of old and new knowledge. Clay for demonstrating a love of books even though he grew up in heavily hi-tech era, and Ajax for showing his willingness to use computers on an ancient code.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The setting helps to draw the comparison between old and new knowledge. It is not a coincidence that much of the story takes place in San Francisco, California, a state that many people would normally associated with innovation and technology-Google, Facebook, Silicone Valley etc. Within that setting, you have both new knowledge and the old knowledge, as found in Mr. Penumbra’s book store versus the technology that many of the characters continually reference. Then, you have the city of New York, which was founded much earlier than San Francisco. I believe that the much older city of New York versus the newer city of San Francisco is another way of comparing old versus new knowledge. I say that because Kat’s character, for example, makes many references to technology based in California, such as google. Compare this to the events that happen in New York-which took place mostly in the reading room, which contains books that are hundreds of years old.

As for the intended readers of this book, I am not sure most people over 40 would understand many of the references. It is most suited to people in their 20’s-like most of the characters in the story are. To be honest, I had to look up some of the terms to know whether they were made up or not. This  makes me think i’m not the only one lost on some of the references. As for comment press itself, i think it is a very helpful tool for this task. On the other hand, it is hard not to notice the reoccurring theme of technology in this book, as to name one example, there are dozens of references to google in this book.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Identifying technological things can help us understand the setting by seeing how pervasive these things (like google, the internet, cell phones and seemingly intangible things like 3D visualisations) have become in our lives. 
I don't think marking-up the text makes it either easy or hard to interpret any deeper meaning because technology is just a tool in the book. Tagging it sort of highlights the messages and adds a sense of contrast between "old knowledge" and the new way of doing things. The way technology is used shows that old knowledge isn't sacrosanct in the age of the internet and should be open to re-interpretation. It makes the book more interesting because it's easy to visualize this world where tech is everywhere, but as a plot device it could have been replaced with something else.. (the steps from A to B would be different, but we'd still learn the same lesson)

The book is definitely geared towards the younger generation, perhaps starting at people who grew up or were born in the 80's or 90's and onwards. I had one grandmother who was a little knowledgeable about technology and the internet, but anyone beyond my siblings going up the family tree would be really hard-pressed understanding this book fully. If they persevered to the end, they might ultimately "get it" but a lot of the context would be lost on them. 
Clay and Neel are very tech savvy and incorporate it into their daily lives, but Kat is definitely more immersed in tech culture. There is a pretty fair spectrum of technological involvement among the characters in the book, but there is more of an emphasis on characters who know a lot about technology.

CommentPress looks like a really useful tool. I think it will just take some getting use-to, but I found it hard to keep track of where my comments were.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[After having read the book “Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore”, by Robin Sloan, I found it very useful to mark up the text with technological references. The majority of this book was a fairly straightforward read, although there were some excerpts that were a bit more difficult to understand at a first glance. This is where marking up the technological references became helpful. While some of them were particularly obvious, others were not and required some research to fully understand. This contributed to properly understanding the plot, the general idea of the plot was clear, whereas some of the many different types of technology they used to accomplish it was slightly more confusing prior to the mark up module. 
	Robin Sloan incorporates a variety of different references to technology that make this book seem to narrow down its target market to a younger generation, namely teenagers and young adults, who use technology daily. However, Sloan uses an interesting contrast between Clay and Mr. Penumbra which enables the reader to notice the differences and even some similarities between the newer technological knowledge of Clay and the more old fashioned knowledge of Mr. Penumbra. Even better yet, the reader gets to see the way how Clay and Mr. Penumbra combine their knowledge, both new and old to accomplish the same goal. This also plays a large part in the setting of the book. Clay must figure out a way to locate the Unbroken Spine, an ancient book cult and solve the Codex Vitae. Penumbra shares his traditional knowledge of this cult with Clay and Clay uses new knowledge and technology to Penumbra’s advantage, such as the GrumbleGear 3000 to infiltrate the Reading Room, along with some help from his tech-savvy friends, Kat and Neel. 
	If my grandmother were to read this book, she would certainly be confused. Although reading is one of her favourite hobbies, technology is like a different language to her, and the constant use of those advanced technological references would likely hinder her comprehension of the book. Nevertheless, if the mark up module was available to all readers of this book, it would be more widely understood by people who do not yet have a complete grasp on technology.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I found the CommentPress fairly easy to use, although I knew most of the technological terms before hand this exercise made me realize how much I overlooked most of the terms while reading the book. The reasoning behind overlooking them was because I was familiar with the terms and what they meant, if my grandmother were to read it she would definitely have trouble understanding it. Mainly because she doesn't speak English, but the fact that the targeted audience is for younger adults. The contrast between old knowledge and new knowledge is significant, and shows just how much technology is taking over. The conflict between all the modern "tech-savvy" characters and the ones who protected the reading room which allowed no technology was prominent. And there is also the thought of libraries being so scarce nowadays because many prefer e-books on their kindles or audio books. I'm all for new technology but I love my paperback novels.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[CommentPress is a wonderful and is easy to learn. It was helpful with the exercise for it showed other students comments and gave me a good understanding of what to do for the activity. Although being a hybrid class I felt that CommentPress allowed us to interact with fellow classmates. (the gif was funny)

The tagging/Mark-up Module exercise was a fun activity. Looking through the paragraphs identifying certain technological terms in the text help me understand Clay’s world a little bit better. Although being part of today tech savvy generation, the text allowed me to get familiar with certain words such as “pirate libraries”. This allowed me to really understand the setting of the novel, Clay mind. 

At first I thought this book would be only suitable for our generation but with CommentPress and other sources, older generations could understand the technological terms used. My parents are slowly getting used to technology using tablets, laptops and cellphones, even having a facebook account. Thus learning the technological terms shouldn’t be hard for older generations, but as other stated that may be a different story for my grandparents.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Instructions:</strong> <em>Due for the Jan. 21st class.</em> This module is about context, codes, and interpretation. It's also about how <a href="https://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=context%20define" target="_blank">context</a> informs how we understand and create meaning out of objects and things we read.

A rough synonym for context is <a href="https://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=setting+define" target="_blank">setting</a>, which we have talked about in class. Setting is a literary term we use to help situate, or position, or place texts so that we can talk about them intelligently and generate discussion about what they might mean. Context does the same thing, but it's much more fluid and can apply to things outside the text itself. Context can include other literary terms such as <a href="https://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=narrative+define" target="_blank">narrative</a>, and <a href="https://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=intertextuality+define" target="_blank">intertextuality</a>. In short, context is a way of thinking about how setting, narrative, intertextuality play together. It is a way of interpreting and understanding how the text is put together or "constructed." Understanding how something is put together allows us to interpret it better. We can compare it to other things put together in a similar way (to other novels, for instance), or about similar things (to other stories), or that have similar parts (hackers as characters).

In sum, contextualizing a text by understanding how it fits in with other things is an important step to making it mean something.

There are many ways to mark up a book--you marked up words in the last module. <em>Mr. Penumbra's 24 Hour Bookstore</em> takes books as one of its primary subjects--along with codes, mythology, cults, collectives, collaboration, old and new knowledge, hacking, new media, and technology. The book also relies on our assumptions or expectations about books--the context in which we find books is the bookstore, for instance or, computers give us a context in which to solve codexes but the meaning of life lies outside the coldness of technological computation.

This week's lab tries to get you thinking about how something is "marked" by others and how that mark governs how we receive the "thing" and interpret things about it, such as the order in which it is presented, its age, the group it belongs to, how it is / has been used (its context!).

Below are a few examples:

<strong>Summary:</strong>

<strong>Task:</strong> Go to the library and seek out a few books from the stacks. Take a look at how those books are "encoded," how are they marked, situated, or represented outside their subject headings--avoid the obvious like "this is a history book in the History section," that's lame. Think about how the book--or object--is put in context.

<strong>Outcomes:</strong> Think about how books are encoded already and how this plays out in <em>Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore</em>:
<ul>
	<li>Describe how your books are marked? What might these marks mean? What do they tell us about the book and its history, audience, content, or context?</li>
	<li>How does the library organize itself? What are the underlying principles behind the organizing system and how are these codes that need to be deciphered?</li>
	<li>Imagine you are discovering the Douglas College library in some distant future (like 4400CE) and you need to disentangle it, what rules would you write down to help others use it to discover Old Knowledge (OK) and why?</li>
<li>How does <em>Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore</em> use conventions you've discovered about books above to make the story compelling?</li>
</ul>

<strong>Takeaways:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Avoid situating texts in made-up contexts, such as assuming it was written when people were less literate. Instead, look at the text and use what you see about it as the guiding principle for contextual assumptions</li>
<li>Take account of your own assumptions about reading, organization, and interpretation. Are those assumptions borne out through the text? Or are you simply relying on your assumptions?</li>
<li>Context often determines how we read or "decode" something. If we find the book in a College or University library, we assume it is of a certain quality or intellectual level and read it accordingly. Whereas if we pick up a magazine at a Drug Store, we approach reading much differently. Texts often try to pressure our "decoding" forcing us to engage with new ways of understanding the text's context<li>
<li>Any analysis always begins with surfaces. You need to have evidence for a context in order to place the text within that context.</li>
</ul>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The first thing that I noticed is that almost the books in the Douglas College library the bar code starts with "1 5400". The purpose of the bar code enables the scanner to know that these books belong to Douglas College by that number. Also each numbers near the end of the book identify what book that is.

What really interest me us in the reference section, the codes on the side of these reference books are used to identify what type of book it is by using letters. This is how the library organize itself. For instance, “ML” books are about music/references to music or “J” books have articles/journals/papers about parliament. Below the letter, there is a number and all the books have that same number comes from the same series/author. As we get toward the bottom of the code, they identify these books by versions and what year it was published. Also, most of the reference books in one aisle have stamps on top of the pages, meaning that they are purchased at the same time or organized/sorted out on the shelf at the same time. Furthermore, these books are situated in the area where there is nobody there, which means these books are meant for specific people such as people studying music, law, nursing, etc. 

Some of these books (mostly law books) from the reference section are from 1896 or dusty on top of the pages. There were no pencil markings, and so I would assume that barely anyone uses it since younger generations would not understand it because the book is out dated/out of context. The way the library organizes makes me see these books differently, for example, I would not understand or disagree about some of the papers written in the law book because it is outdated, similar the way Clay does not understand old knowledge out of old books.

Clay uses similar conventions that I have discovered about books because there is a section in Mr. Penumbra’s bookstore that is only used by the members of the Unbroken Spine (located many feet from the ground). Those books are used to break the code for internal life and members do not “understand” the books because it is out of context.

Overall the lab is really frustrating for me because it is hard to describe the book in terms of context and make connections to Mr. Penumbra’s 24-hr Bookstore.

I hope that I am doing this right.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Before starting this assignment, I was lucky enough to have books rented out from the library for my Criminology class. At first glance, these books look very old as the writing on most pages points it out. The library seems to be in need of a “newer” edition of these books. What is evident from looking at these books is the markings that clearly show they are from the library. The barcode also supports this concept. Furthermore, it clearly says “Douglas College Library” on top of the barcode. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out where this book came from! However, another important observation is the published year written on the side markings. By looking at all three of my books, the markings show me that my oldest book was published in 1988, while the latest one was published in 2000. When I look inside all three of the books, the circling or underlining of words show me that they were of great importance to the previous readers. Maybe these books were used for research? Maybe for school assignments? The circled or underlined words clearly were vital to whoever was reading it.
	When I try to analyze the context of the books, two of the three books give me a general idea in what I am about to read. One book has Aboriginal people hugging on its cover with the title “Returning to the Teachings: Exploring Aboriginal Justice”. The second book is called “Canadian Mental Health Law and Policy” and it has a red cover. These observations give me the general context in what the book is about or what the text will revolve around. However, the third book is a complete mystery. The cover and back is completely grey with no title on either side. When I tilt the book sideways, the title is shown in small writing. The title is “Resistance and Renewal”. However, this analysis does not give me the general context of the book. I would have to open it up and read it to know what it is about. Simply reading the title does not give me any hint as it can still be about anything. Without this module, I would have never analyzed a books marking or context. People generally never look for these things as books are just used for reading content inside.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Of the various types of books I saw, I noticed several cook books were stained with splatters of food and oil. Perhaps the readers were cooking while looking at the recipes or maybe flipping the pages with filthy fingers. The more stained pages could suggest that those recipes are favoured, tastier, or just messier to cook. Also, the cook books with more pictures tend to be more worn down which may suggest that readers are actually more visually attracted to the food than to recipes that are text alone.
Something I have also noticed about all books in the particular library I explored was that they all have marks on the bottom. These marks signify how many times a book has been circulated over time. This in itself could give a great indication of how old a book is in general or compared to the other copies. Could even give an indication of how popular that book is. This way of tracking circulation is, however, being phased out which subsequently may signal what time period that particular book is from.

The library is organized by mediums and then more finely by a numbering system. The main sections include books, magazines, CDs, and DVDs. Each medium is then divided again several times over for various reasons whether its targeted audience, genre, or subject to name a few. For example, within the medium of books, the books are divided into fiction and non-fiction. I took a look at non-fiction and found that non-fiction is then divided into 10 different groups. Each group then corresponds to a range of numbers that are divided even further by category and ordered by author. These numbers are ordered accordingly by Dewey Decimal Classification numbers. 
The books’ codes can be deciphered using the Dewey Decimal system because each number corresponds to a specific subject.

I have no idea why, but I find making up rules so challenging, not to mention frustrating! Its probably because I hardly pay attention to rules... Anyhow, my one rule for 'disentangling' the library in the distant future would be to "memorize the category names and numbers of the universal library system known as the Dewey Decimal System and use those range of numbers and their respective categories to FIGURE IT OUT!"... Festina Lente people!

On another note, the Unbroken Spine’s thirst for knowledge puts into perspective how much knowledge there is in the world. One of the great reasons why the story is so compelling is that it points out how one could dedicate their whole life to decoding, reading, and understanding information of this world, but never decode, read, or understand it ALL. Whether it is OK or TK, no one will ever know it all. It reminds me of a short story called the “Library of Babel”. Both the novel and the short story encompass the idea that even though there is a definite amount of information to consume, there is far too much for any one person to take in.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Looking through the books at the library I noticed that out of about the one hundred books I looked at all of them have a bar code. This ensures that the library keeps tract of the books that are checked out and checked back into the library. The bar code would also be a security feature as an alarm will sound if you leave the library without checking out a book. Another feature that many of the books have is a flap on the first page of the book. Some of these flaps include a date which says something about when the book was received by the library. Also on the tops of several of the books is a Douglas College stamp. These stamps all have different fonts with different colours. The library has probably changed it's stamp and ink colour a lot over the years. It is clear that the library wants to maintain the books and make them last since many of the paperback books have a plastic covering on the outside. 

The majority of libraries organize themselves using the Dewey Decimal Classification System. There are ten broad categories in this system such as arts and religion. Since colleges and universities typically have an even broader spectrum of topics, they use the Library of Congress Classification System which is the system the Douglas College library uses. On the bottom of the spine of each book you will find an abbreviation of the topic and the initial of the authors last name which makes up the call number. The bottom line is the publication date. An example would look something like this:
BJ
1496
L476
2009
With this system, similar topics are grouped together which makes finding books much easier. If a library was organized at random it would take hours to find a book you are looking for. 

If someone were to discover this library in the future there would be some things they would need to know. First of all, topics are grouped into sections. Once you find the section that your book will be under it shouldn't take you too much longer to find the book. I would also describe to them how the Library of Congress system works. But, when in doubt, use one of the computers in the library to find a book you are looking for or ask a librarian.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The library marks books in various ways with library barcodes, library name, and some form of the Dewey decimal classification system. These methods create an identification tool for the property of the library. Looking at my own books, there is only the barcode that came on the book when it was printed. The books on my bookshelves are organized into genres like the library but we did not add a classification system to organize it. There are no names on the bottom of my books. However on children’s books that belonged to my brother or I, contain our names on the first page of the book. This was to identify that the book belonged to us when we had to take a book to school. The difference between personal and public books is the name to which the book is identified by. A public library name on a book means that the book has been seen by many people with that membership and a book with one person’s name or no name is either private use or family use. 
       The organization of the library, like my own, has the principle idea of organizing the books by the type of usage they may go through and the content to which they keep. Books for research will all be in the same section of the library and organized by subject and type of content. The Douglas College library, in some ways has this type of organization. The library is divided up into sections through the use of numbers which is reflected first in the Dewey Decimal system and represents the type of information in the book. The letters then represent the author or publisher. In many ways this relates to how Mr.Penumbra keeps his bookstore. 
         In the back of the bookstore, Mr.Penumbra keeps books with a different contents and usage from those at the front of the bookstore. This type of organization in the bookstore reflects that of the library and sections that are for those with a membership and those without. The setup of Mr.Penumbras bookstore makes the story compelling because it peeks the interest of belonging, in the sense of books and the type of people using them. It compels the reader to ask what type of people get to view these books and why the store is assembled the way it is.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[My book has multiple markings on it; the most obvious ones are the ones that let the individual know that it is a library book. The book has a Douglas College Library stamp on the bottom of the book, the stamp is very faded and difficult to recognize and read. This suggests that this book was purchased many years ago since the stamp on it is no longer legible. The book also has the little pouch on the first page for bookmarks and most new books in libraries no longer have that present as well. The pages on my book are yellowish colour with staining towards the edge of the pages, which further demonstrates how long ago this book was purchased. The book has no cover image, it is just a plain blue hardcover book. Due to it lacking an image on the cover and the bright colour of its cover, it makes it a novel that will stand out. Most people would stop and look at it out of curiosity to see what it is about, as it doesn’t even have the title of the book on the cover. My book is a children’s book, which is probably why it has a bright cover compared to the normal dark colours most novels have. Although it has no images on the cover, the book itself has plenty of images inside that would suggest to someone just skimming through the pages that it is a children’s novel. The font in the book is larger compared to normal novels since its most likely easier for the children to read it. Also it’s composed of short stories rather than one large story with chapters, since children usually read short stories.
I think the library organizes itself by genre, since I found this novel with other children’s book. Also when I was looking for another novel it was with other classic novels, so I am assuming that the library is set up according the genre of the books.
Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore uses these decoding methods to make it interesting for the reader. They point out marks that are obvious or we would not be able to put together until it is mentioned and that keeps the reader guessing.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[When looking at several books at the library the first thing I noticed was the barcode on the top of the books. Each Douglas library book was given a barcode with the digits starting with 1 5400. I assumed this meant that the book belongs to Douglas College. I’m guessing this lets the library know who checked a book out and when a book is checked back in. After looking into the books I also noticed a Douglas College stamp that’s somewhere at the start of the book, usually on the top corner of the first couple of pages. Just from this it’s easy to understand that the book belongs to Douglas College. When opening the books I noticed that some had a pouch but nothing inside. From what I remember the pouches were used as a check out sheet but as new technology came in I guess this wasn’t needed anymore but it could also be what the example showed, historical mark that shows the books age. When analyzing the spine of the books I saw certain number and letters a book was given. At first I wasn’t too sure what this meant for I rarely go into our school library to read. I later found out it was a way of how the library organized itself. The code would first have a letter, for example “GV” which was books about physical education. Afterward a number is stated below then a number/letter code and then the year it was published. With this it’s easier to find book in a certain genre. One last thing I noticed was another stamp with a date and a year. This maybe indicates when the book was purchased?


When analyzing one book I came across some pencil marks. From the looks of it a student was studying fitness fundamentals. Key points in the text where underlined such as “aerobics means using oxygen”. After flipping a few pages after I found an old receipt with other books that focuses on fitness and health, being checked out all at once. This gave me the assumption that the student had an interest into health and fitness and could be in sport science.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[When looking at the various books I have taken out from a library, I notice that they’re marked by barcodes in the front page. This is for the purpose of the library so the books can be scanned and be kept tracked of and to update the library’s system about the inventory status of the book.  I also noticed in the first couple of pages of the books there are dates stamped which indicates when the books were received by the library.  An interesting mark I found in a book was the top corner of the certain pages were folded which I assume was used as a book marker by a previous reader. And in some books the pages were also ripped and appeared more worn than others. I can assume that the books that look worn and have ripped pages have been read more. 

The books also have letters on the spine of the book which is used in reference to the type, and section of the books. This is a way for the library to organize their books and a way for people to easily find the books they are looking for. The letters and /or numbers correspond to specific genre and types of books thus making it simple for someone to find the specific books or books within that genre or specific subject. Mr. Penumbra’s 24-bookstore uses similar conventions by the way his book store is set up and also how Clay uses the Mac plus to find certain books requested. The book store also has members like how a library has members, and in Mr. Penumbra’s 24-hour bookstore its members uses a card with letters and numbers just like how a member of the library would use a library card. The story is compelling because of the mystery and adventure elements and how the story shows the progression use of technology from the beginning of the book till the end. From Clay starting his job at the bookstore, Clay’s quest to break a code in a book, to the actual decoding of the book.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The first thing I stopped to think about as I started walking through the aisles of books in the library was how organized and systematic they were. I noticed how they were all in rows assigned from left to right, placed upright side by side to one another, except in the case where a few books were too tall for the shelf and had to be placed sideways. The first visible code from a majority of the books was the Dewey Decimal barcode taped onto the spine on the books. I happened to be looking in the 700 section of the library, which encodes for Arts and Recreation, where I found a book on rites of passage. 

The book was marked in several ways, first and foremost with the call number of HQ 796 K487 1977. Secondly, I opened it up and saw the pocket on the first page. It was however only partially there as it seems like someone has previously tried to rip it out since it was of no use anymore. Back in elementary school when I signed out books from our school library, filling out my name on the little card was my favourite part. Another mark I saw on the book was “doggy ears”, or every English instructor’s worst nightmare. Users in the past didn’t have a bookmark, a scrap peeve of paper, or even a paper clip to mark where they were up to reading the book, so they felt the need to ruin the pages by flipping over the top right bit, by a couple centimetres, to do the job. The book was over three hundred pages so it might not have been something someone wanted to read all at once. 

The underlying code for the books organization as mentioned is the Dewey Decimal Classification, a numerical system for organizing nonfiction books based on ten different subject categories numbered 000’s; 100’s; 200’s and so on. Within the ten different categories lie subcategories, which are decoded by the second two digits, ei: 123. The conventions used in Mr. Penumbra’s 24 Hour Bookstore makes the books compelling because it not only the books themselves that tell the story of old knowledge, but their sequencing and unlocking them in that sequence.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Having seen a variety of books on the shelves, I've noticed that some books had a brighter and sharper countenance than the others. This suggests that the brighter looking ones were more recently bought or less used than those with a darker appeal in colour. I've also noticed the complex and complicated numerical and alphabetical coding on the spines of the books. I suspect that this is done to group them according to the topics which they cover, followed by other numbers for titles and volumes of the books.

One particular book that I had picked out of the shelf is called the "Bread and Roses." It doesn't have any "Douglas Library" stamp anywhere. This suggests that this book was probably purchased before they started stamping the books, or they merely forgot or missed stamping it. Also, the book hasn't been used much as it is still really stiff in structure when you open it.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[For this module, I went to the library looking for books that had some sort of markings in order to learn more about their history. All of the books in the library had a bar code sticker, usually taped on one of the covers.  The sticker has ‘Douglas College Library’ written above the bar code, and a series of numbers below it. This bar code sticker is scanned when checking out a book, resulting in the book’s information to appear from the library database.  The library database, or catalogue, allows one to determine whether or not a book is available, where it can be found and when it is expected to return, thus proving to be an organizational tool. In addition to the bar code sticker, the inside cover of my book has a small, empty pouch. This pouch was once used for signing out books - or at least that’s how I remember it during elementary school! There would be an index card where you would write your name and the date you borrowed it and it would be kept inside the pouch. This is a much older technique that does not require the use of computers which allows one to assume that this book has been around for more than a decade. This assumption can be further proved by the remnants of another sticker on the inside cover with the date September 27th 1978 stamped under the heading ‘Due Date’. Not only does this stamp give a rough estimation of how old the book is, it also demonstrates another example of an organizational technique used when technology was not the go-to option. Overall, the book itself seems to be in good condition, perhaps as a result of insignificant use, but regardless it carries some clues to its history.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The books I analyzed in the library all had markings on them, with some markings on everyone and others having very unique markings. All the books in the library I saw had bar codes on the outside and each had their own Douglas College stamp. The bar code gives the book a tracking number for the library computer system while the stamp shows that it belongs to Douglas College. The books also all had letters with number on the side that are organized alphabetically so readers can find books very efficiently just like the system Clay used in the bookstore. Through seeing both newer and older much more worn books I could see many differences in the markings. The older books were the ones that tended to have more unique markings. Many of the old books had a pouch inside of them with one book I looked at dating back to 1982. Other books had writing in them, worn out pages, ripped pages, water spots, and even highlighted pages indicating that they have been used significantly by past readers. These marks can tell us the history of how old some of these books may be, the audience from what genre the book is, and the context of what the book may be about. 

The Library at Douglas organizes itself into sections such as non-fiction and fiction and the further into categories such as policing or the history of Canada. Books that are next to each other have very similar content. Everything is organized with the alphabetical code system that makes it easy for readers to find the book they are looking for. If I was discovering the library in the future some rules I would suggest to them that certain genres or categories are placed in the same sections just like the bookstore in the novel. However, with Mr. Penumbra’s bookstore it sections the books into where the back of store has the books normal people wouldn’t be interested in and only certain people (Unbroken Spine members) get to see it. It makes the story compelling because the reader wants to know the context behind the books and why these people are the only ones who get to see these mysteriously hidden books. Who knows what could be hiding in the Douglas College Library.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Looking through the library bookshelves, I found several specific markings on books that caught my attention. I could piece together a story from older books before that of new ones since they are little more than glossy covers and crisp pages. Their placement in the library tells what kind of book they are, normally by genre and alphabetically by author. Their spine gives us an idea of what the book is about, displaying the title and usually the writer. However, the wreckage of the book is where the magic happens. One novel was obviously ancient because it was hanging together with no more than masking-tape and lamination. Another had doodles all over the cover and the inner pages, indicating that a prior user was somewhat disrespectful of both the author and the college itself. It’s important to be observant of the context in which something remains in order to gather as much information as possible. 

Many of the books have interesting titles to draw individuals in. They also create captivating covers that spike one’s interest and force you to pick up the book and start reading. Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore, for example, compels readers by way of the title and by the first few sentences of chapter one. The writer makes the introductory paragraph very exciting so you are unable to put the book down and are seduced into reading further. And, who wouldn’t want to read about a 24-hour bookstore whose owner has a unique name like Penumbra?

In the Douglas College library, I made quick assumptions almost right away of the content of the racks. The books are expected to be educational and used for school purposes. I would have thought that all the books would be presenting intelligent topics or be stories used in classes. However, upon my visit, I noticed many leisurely novels such as Holes and even the Twilight series. I was somewhat surprised and thrown off by the presence of these titles in a college library which indicated the expectations that I held for its contents. Thinking about it now, the purpose of libraries are to promote reading. Thus, if all the college books were used for classes only, there would be little selection for those who just want to read for fun.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I only had one book taken out from the library for my educational psychology class. I noticed the standard, obvious bar code on both the front cover and edge of the book. The edges are worn out and had a couple of post it notes peeking out from the top, along with tons of underlining and highlighting which tells me that the person or people before me actually made good use of the book while studying. Although since it's to be returned there wasn't much care for the book. Since it's mainly used by college students for classes I had already assumed it would be pretty worn out and the highlighting inevitable. - Then I looked at the books my younger brothers had taken out from their school library, which had the little cards and pockets on the inside of the front cover detailing each sign out. A few of the books had doodles, which again, is expected from elementary school students. I figured their conditions wouldn't be the greatest, but to my surprise they have taken care of the books very well.  
   The most used system is the dewey decimal classification, but if all the books were categorized alphabetically and by genre it would be the easiest way to remember where the books are located no matter what time period we are in. 
Mr.Penumbra's bookstore was more interesting because there was an entire section unknown to the public eye, and only a certain few people were able to take them out This strikes curiosity which made the book compelling. How could have they been admitted to Mr.Penumbra's library? They must have had a completely different set of barcodes (if any at all) in order for the unbroken spine members to be the only ones to be able to take them out. Over all, this was frustrating because I don' t have a knack for detail and this made me impatient.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The books in the library are shelved according to the Dewey Decimal System, as others have mentioned.. this system sorts books by their genre (fiction vs non-fiction, and progressively more narrow) and are assigned a corresponding number. Within a similar subject matter, they are sorted by author and titles. 

The books I found weren't marked too much on the pages by readers, but it was easy to see where the most read sections of the book were, judging by the wear on the spine and the subtle ways the edges of the pages were worn and discolored.  I'd say from my assumptions of the readers that they were respectful of the text and/or the fact that it wasn't their property and therefore didn't chose to mark up the text. Perhaps they photocopied sections they needed. 

I'm really not sure how I would create rules to disentangle the library in the future because I already know how the library works. I might try to map out where each type of subject matter is stored with a floor plan and try to determine which number/letter combination was similar between books of the same subject, then I would probably try to refine sub-categories within those areas and see which letter/number combos related to that. It makes sense because I've always seen books organized that way, and it's similar to how I organize my books at home.

In Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore, he sorts things by genre as well, but uses different criteria for it. The "regular" books that would be bought/sold in a normal bookstore are at the front of the store and sorted on different shelves; the special codex vitae books are all towards the back and are strictly for borrowing. I'm curious about whether the books are shelved according to chronology, name/author or something else (judging from the data visualisation Clay created that showed the face when he put in the data about which books were taken out). I wonder if there are some books in that store (and in the college library) that will never be borrowed or read at all]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[While observing the variety of different books in the Douglas College Library, I noticed they were all marked up, some were marked up similarly and others were marked up differently, but every type of mark had its own purpose. First of all, every book comes with a barcode in the top left corner. Of all the books I saw, the first five numbers of each barcode were the same, 15400. The rationality behind this same number at the start of each barcode is so that when it is scanned, it will automatically be recognized as a product of the Douglas College Library. Secondly, the majority of the books in the library come with a “Douglas College Library” stamp on the top. The stamps come in all sorts of colours and fonts, but mostly tend to be either black, red, or blue. This is to indicate the various different times of arrivals of these books, since if they came in at the same time, they would be stamped with the same colour and font. Also, some of the books come with a pouch on the first page, however these books tend to be the older ones and we can use these pouches to guess the age of the book.

The library seems to use the Dewey Decimal system to organize their vast collection of books. In the bottom left corner of the books, there is a white sticker, each containing four lines. For example, BL 240 R877 1961. The last line is the year of publication and the second line is a number grouped into hundreds. Each of these groups of hundreds numbers serves the purpose of indicating the genre of the book, such as history, technology, or philosophy. 

If I were to rediscover the Douglas College Library in the distant future, I would hope that some new rules would have been implemented. Personally I think that books should be organized in categories first based on genre, and then based on author’s name in alphabetical order, and last but not least, separated by century of publication, so it would be easier to find old knowledge on different shelves instead of being mixed in with more recent books.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[After searching through various books, I found some check out receipts that were left in some of them. Some of these dated as far back as 2003. This is a possible indication that those books don't get checked out frequently, but this is not certain. However, all the check out receipts showed multiple books in the same subjects. This gives a possible clue as to the audience of those books i.e history majors, perhaps, checking out multiple books on history. One check out receipt listen two books that were both available in the library at the time.Both books had pages highlighted in yellow marking. It appears staff members also wrote, in pen, inside the book, to indicate that the highlighting was noticed March 2004. The check out receipt for those books showed that the items were due March.2003. This is an indication that the same people could likely be highlighting multiple books in the same way, while checked out at the same time. Other books I saw were highlighted differently; some had post it notes left inside, and others had passages underlined in pencil. 

As for Douglas library specific markings, red ink seems to commonly identify the year 1995, but not always, and the year 1995 often contain pouches inside the books. 

The library uses an alphanumeric system to group the same subjects together. The numbers and letters themselves are ambiguous but they indicate a specific location where items can be found.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I noticed that the majority of the books in the library at Douglas were fairly old.  I found this out because the books that were older had yellowed pages at the edges and had bent corners. The fiction section seemed to have the most use because the books were worn out and some had rips taped up. I like the worn out books because they’ve been taken out a lot so the stories are probably good. I found the section with the encyclopedias and they had a lot of dust on them. This is probably because students do not go to this section when they have a multiple sets of encyclopedias on their phones and computers. There were some magazines hidden in the back of the library probably because they are also available online. It seemed that items that could not be found easily online, like novels, were near the front of the library and the items that could be online were in the back of the library.  

	People make a lot of assumption about reading whether they want to or not. The most popular assumption is the classic saying “don’t judge a book by its cover.” Even though everyone knows not to do this, they can’t help but be slightly more interested in books with exciting covers. As well, most the time as readers are reading, they are constantly trying to figure out the climax of the story. The best kind of stories are the ones that keep you second guessing your assumptions with new clues to what the resolution to the conflict in the story will be. This will keep your reader interested in a book. The setting of a story can also change the assumptions of the reader. “The Bug” is a good example of this because the setting is in a computer programmers mind so the reader might initially think that the story line will be very logical and bland. With further reading they will find the story line that is very enticing.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[For this weeks task I chose books from the coquitlam library that I found to be marked up differently than some of the others. For example, at this public library there are different sections marked off for targeted audiences such as the teen section, kiddie corner etc. I noticed right away that the books in the kids section were almost all laminated with crinkled edges and bright coloured animations on the covers. The ones tucked away and lined up tightly together were situated on the back shelves. From the context, since the covers weren't on display, and once the books were pulled out and the covers had faded pictures with a brown tinge to them, it implied they had been there for some time and that kids didn't find these books as popular anymore. You could also tell these books on the back shelves were old due to the pockets on the first page that have cards that used to be for writing your name and date on before signing out a book. I remember doing this in elementary school however it is not required to do so anymore. 
Another section was the self help section and one of the books I chose belonged to the "How to.. for dummies" series. These books are marked with bright yellow and black markings on the cover and are commonly known for helping people complete tasks in the simplest way possible. The one I picked up In particular was for help with using Microsoft office, you could tell a lot of people didn't know how to use this program because the pages were bent, indicating people wanted to save the spot they were reading. some parts were highlighted, indicating that those sections in particular were important (even though i'm pretty sure you're not allowed to mark up a library book) but either way the condition it was left in showed traces of someone who had trouble understanding their software and marked up the book to help them understand. 
I noticed that one section of the library had books marked up with numbers and letters, aka the dewey decimal system that has been mentioned so I wont repeat it again and the other half was only organized alphabetically by author. Honestly, I find the dewey decimal system to be confusing and feel like alphabetically arranging books makes more sense, especially by author. 
If I had to help people from the future find OK, I would explain how computers can search by keywords and authors within that database to find any book that the library has. 
This task definitely made me realize I need to go to the library more often.. just like in Penumbras 24 hr bookstore there is a lot of old knowledge to bring out of the bookshelves.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[In some of the dictionaries I was looking at they were all marked up, different uses of specific words were underlined and starred. The hard cover of books looked like they have seen better days, as the edges were folded in and the paper has started to tare. Some of the books I was looking at were not all the same height or width, even though they may be about the same thing written by different authors, each had different amount of information. This reminded me when Clay was in the underground library in New York and was searching for Penumbras codex vitae and he noticed that all the other bound members of the “cult” had their books small, tall, skinny, and large etc. I found some books were very dusty and old to the point where the paper has turned a yellow color that indicated they are quite old.

The reference section interested me the most because of all the history and information there was and how organized it was. Every date was in exact order. In old news articles/journals some of the pages were torn and ripped up, meaning in that particular time many people used it as a reference or an event/person was popular and everyone was reading about it.. In some areas of the library I noticed a lot of the books were organized in periodical manner that reminded me of Penumbras book store and the waybacklist. The library organizes itself by numbers and barcodes. I noticed the barcode for Douglas college started with “1 5400” indicating that all books belonging to Douglas start with that number. Also the library seemed to be set up into different genres.

For this lab I thought it was different but at the same time it made me realize and make a connection with Mr. Penumbras 24 Hour Bookstore that every single book is different in it’s own way (obviously) but some say there are good books and bad books but, are there really though? I mean people put their all into books and write for reasons us as readers may not understand.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[When going through the library I went to the biology section first and found a lot of thicker books with hard covers. These gave me clear indications that they were text books. Also when you went to open these text books in a few of them I found some sticky notes stuck to certain pages with notes on them reminding the person of what was on the page and paraphrasing what they were learning. You can tell that the people who borrowed these books from the library were studying or trying to learn new subjects with great deal of focus from all the notes you see everywhere rather than reading them for pleasure. In the older, more used textbooks I found a few with writing directly on the pages and people had highlighted important parts on certain pages. I also went to another section that was filled with older novels, and you could tell they were older from the colour that they had turned a tinge of yellow from sitting on the shelves and for being used after so many years. There were a few books that had coffee stains and the paper back books had bends in the cover and creases. You can tell that these books had been used a lot from the wear and tear compared to some of the newer ones that barely even look like they've been touched or moved at all. I also went to a section in the library where I found blue dots on all the labels along with letters and numbers. I knew that the letters and numbers on the labels of the spine corresponded to the dewey decimal system, but the blue dots indicated that the books were not in english but in French. This was helpful in the sense that if you knew you were looking for a novel in French you can just automatically look for the blue dot on the spine of the book and it narrows down your search a lot. 
Like most libraries it is organized by the Dewey Decimal system. Even though I personally find it confusing to try and learn it, since I am not in libraries all that often, it is useful that all the libraries around where I live use the same system. If I were to try and help someone look up old knowledge in the future this could come in handy since you only need to explain it once in one library and almost every other one that they go to it will be the same system. If I could I would make the organization a little less complicated. Rather than using letters and numbers I would probably just go alphabetically since everyone knows the alphabet and it would be easy to look books up if you know the title, only downside though subjects of the same genre wouldn’t be in the same section like it is now with the Dewey Decimal system.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[A couple of the books I borrowed were drawn from Tommy Douglas Library. These books have different markings compared to the ones from Douglas College Library. These ones have numbers at the bottom indicating its location according to genre located at the spine of the books. Under these numbers, the first three letters of the author’s surname is also provided for readers to easily locate where these books might be. A particular book actually has a black dot, with the author’s surname, indicating that it’s from the teenage or young adult book section of the library. Aside from the barcode stickers at the front of the books, they also have the “Burnaby Public Library” stamp at the top. Each book also has different fonts, thus bought at different years; some have it very bold and striking, while others are extremely thin to the point where I can’t see some of the letters. One book in particular has a stamp on the first page, it indicates that the book was withdrawn, and I believe that this book is actually free since after scanning the book out, the librarian blocked out the barcode with a black marker. Perhaps the book had to be liquidated for a better copy? Considering its paper is truly yellow stained and its cover’s battered state. Or maybe, the library needed space for a better book? Either way I felt sad for the book for some reason, it felt as if it lost its home; the place where it used to live since it was stamped last June of 1999. I’m guessing Penumbra and the cult-of-black-robed-New-Yorkers felt the same way I did whenever someone’s life or book was burned in the library. Mr. Penumbra’s 24 Hour Bookstore used codes similar to our libraries today to make the story compelling with how the books are uniquely named: very uncommon and hard to pronounce book titles. Aside from the uncommon names, these books have their letter U’s spelled as V’s, it separates the books that are being encoded for the answer to eternal life than the ones that are for sale and ordinary ones.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The books are marked differently, not all, but most.  I suspect it is because of the material the library has on hand to use to mark books; However, the books in the library have a basic marking on the side of the book: the first two letters of the author’s last name and serial number. The marking of books change as technology changes as the little pouch in books were replaced with barcodes to scan and record with efficiency instead of getting the card, signing your name/date, having the librarian record it into logs… yatayatayata. TK is, most of the time, faster than OK, but can be faster than either if they are balances, and the library can parallel with the book. It can take a person five minutes at most to find and sign out a book by using TK and OK instead of having errors for TK and time inefficiency for OK. It is important to know most of us want “things” as fast a possible. If you were hungry, would you want your food at restaurant in five minutes, or thirty minutes (assuming the food is equal in quality)? 
I think the context is time, and the economy dwindling because of TK. Take for instance people are losing jobs because of machines (e.g. ATM’s, self-serve machines in grocery stores, etc.) that do a better job than people; However Clay was able to crack a code that thousands of computers could not crack, and sheds light to OK by finding a balance between the two knowledge’s. Anyways, That is my intake on “decoding” the book and the assignment you have given us.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The context of where we find the text tells you something about the targeted readers for the book of choice. If you were to target intellectuals you would aim to gain a spot upon a library or college shelves, whereas magazines such as GLAM and such are not targeting intellectuals per say, but the materialistic individuals whom enjoy light reading and getting caught up within the gossip of the superstar world. Not only does the context of where we find a book give us insight to the targeted readers, but also to how we will approach the text itself. If I were to find a book in 7 – 11 I may not even give it a second thought to picking it up and reading it just because of the context in which I had found it in. Whereas if I were to find the same book at say a Chapters under Heathers Picks I may pick it up and scan a few pages. That may be because I am a book snob, or I would relate it more towards the place in where I encountered the book. As well as where a book is spotted, upon the covers of the books are the titles in which there may also be illustrations giving the reader some insight to the style or content of the book and draw readers in. For example harlequin romances often feature a picture of a woman’s figure that some would find enticing, luring in their readers with visual aesthetics. As well the covers of books done by multiple authors tend to follow the same style, almost like the authors signature on the outside of the book, claiming it as one of their creations. At least that’s what I think, it could totally be that the publishers have domain over the visual creations for the books and the publishers are the ones marking the covers in their choice of font, colour and visual style. Either way book with the same authors tends to have similar “markings” upon their covers.

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong> <em>Due for the Jan. 28th class.</em> This module is about looking behind the surfaces so that you are aware of different ways of approaching things--in others words: perspective. It's also about how our point-of-view (POV) informs how we understand texts, create meaning in them, and decipher what might lie under the surfaces (what might a character <em>really</em> mean when they talk about something? What might the symbolic meaning be and why is that symbolic meaning even there?</p>

<!--who has been daring enough to view source on the class website? Can you keep a secret or do you need to tell everyone?-->

<p>Perspective and point-of-view are character-based approaches to interpreting texts, something we'll get to more next week, but it's always helpful to be aware of your own point-of-view or perspective when it comes to thinking about how you read or interpret a text. This awareness of your own perspective ties in nicely with your awareness of context, narrative, and setting in that <em>how you understand</em> context, narrative, and setting is informed by your perspective (or the character's perspective). Understanding your point-of-view or perspective lows you to more acutely understand the perspective or point-of-view in the narrative when you need to write essays or decipher symbolic meaning. As I noted last class, all of these things are tied up in our expectations for the text we are reading. Understanding our perspective allows us to be more accountable to our expectations.</p>

<!--you can get most of what you need from the WAR GAMES MOVIE by going and watching it on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZbXA4lyCtqpGOS2KC1mAAKaGwbup-DQt --> 

<p>In sum, now that we understand how things are "marked" (setting) and "put together" (narrative), we need to think about about <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> they are marked or put together the way they are. In other words, what are the character's motivations for telling the story the way they have? What does the narrator expect the reader to know already and why do s/he expect that? What assumptions does the narrator assume which are informed by the setting in which he is telling the story (think about time/space here--why tell the story in the past tense? Or the present tense? for instance.)</p>

<!--here are the answers to this week's quiz: 
- Code
- A mouse
- A linguistics professor
- Life
- Telligensia
- Punning
- Narrator, Narratee, Site of a text
- The bug
- A talking animal
- Ethan's boss
-->

<p>The narrative point-of-view then tells us a lot about what the narrator knows and the choices s/he is making when they re-tell the story they are telling. They can choose to emphasize certain things (repeated symbols) or leave out things (who is Grumble anyway? why didn't we find out Penumbra was a ex-computer whiz until the end?).</p>

<p>When we read, we are always interpreting by looking beyond surfaces ("Is that egg salad sandwich fresh?" "That shirt looks really nice, bet it's expensive"). In this module we'll look under the surface of websites and think about how our perspective of the web is dependant on our point-or-view.</p>

<!-- Always remember to account for what's right in front of you. Take account of your assumptions and try to work through them. -->

<strong>Summary:</strong>

<strong>Task:</strong> As we reviewed in class, right-click (or ctrl-click) in your browser without highlighting the page and click on ""view page source" or "view source" (in Chrome, Firefox and IE). It's complicated in Safari (https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4325736). You will then see a whole bunch of code. Pick a website you visit frequently. Avoid plain, single-purpose sites like Google; they don't show a lot. You might want to try a few Douglas College webpages.

<p><strong>Outcomes:</strong> Think about how your perspective of websites (the WYSIWYG experience of viewing them) is completely different than how they are coded (what the computer reads). Think about how this dichotomy plays out in the conflict between old knowledge and new knowledge in <em>Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe how the code looks to you. Does it add anything to your experience of the website itself?</li>
<li>How does the webpage organize itself? What are the underlying principles behind the organizing system and who or what does the deciphering, and from what perspective?</li>
<li>Think about the experience of "reading" a web page. Who or what is "reading" it and how are they / it processing that reading? In other words, by encoding the website a certain way, an html coder tells the browser how to read it, or display / organize the information. What does this say about the role a coder's perspective plays in how you receive information on a website?</li>
<li>How does <em>Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore</em> highlight to social conventions of coding and coders while obscuring the real drudgery that goes on behind the scenes (to say nothing of the actual level of technical expertise?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid being unaware of your own perspective or the character's perspective. Everyone has a point-of-view that informs how a story is read and processed.</li>
<li>Pay attention to how things are organized and presented to you. What things (characters, ideas, symbols, objects) are presented to you repeatedly, at key moments, to obscure, to highlight, etc.</li>
<li>Remember that POV is often determined by cultural perspective. Identifying the POV of a novel can tell us lots about the main characters, the  narrative, the setting, and the assumptions that go into organizing and telling the story.</li>
<li>POV is as much about how we read the story as it is about how we see the story being told to us. Try to account for how things are withheld, revealed, obscured, undeveloped, etc., and figure out why that is the case. What's the story NOT telling us in order to TELL us.</li> 
</ul>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I went to http://education-portal.com/academy/lesson/binary-language-of-computers-definition-lesson-quiz.html and viewed the source code. The code looks different, in terms of presentation, compared to the webpage. The code looks to be ten to twenty times the size of the webpage; Moreover, there are links that lead to more codes. Why is the code large, yet, the webpage is small? There must be a giant story behind every solution. The website has a mission and biography, (http://education-portal.com/pages/About_Us.html) to give free education… and to be remembered. A team of people created many complex scripts, to obtain most likely money, or recognition. I feel this collates with Clay because he’s telling a story about his experience being a clerk in a bookstore, while giving limited knowledge along the way. Take for instance how he tells the audience about Kat wearing a red shirt all the time, when later in his STORY and in point of view, we learn about her having several of the same shirts. I feel Clay limits the knowledge he conveys to the audience, because he wants to be close immortal as possible, an excuse to tell a story from how he experienced his adventure for the first time. I think the closest thing to immortality is leaving a legacy behind. Clay did just that. He told his story to thirty-eight students and a teacher to an English Lit. Class, and to thousands of other readers. There’s a good chance he won’t be remembered after this class is over, but at least he told us an adventurous legacy of decoding someone who left a legacy to be decoded, and will be remembered by some people. Moffat also leaves his story in his  “Dragon Song Chronicles”, coded. We were a told a story in his prospective. Clay became as immortal as anyone can ever get. I think one of many messages Robin Sloan conveys is immortality can never be achieved, but leave a legacy behind and become remembered to merit pseudo-immortality.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The code has a generous amount of  symbols, with occasional words that are in English and some that seem to be random letters jumbled together. There are some words in blue, some red and occasionally there are black. I find this incredibly complicated to follow, mostly because this is new knowledge to me. The only thing that is added to my experience of the website itself is appreciation for the people who must’ve spent hours putting this together. 
The experience of ‘reading’ a webpage is clearly more complex and time consuming for the programmer than it is for the intended audience. The page I chose for example was one from the Douglas College website- an FAQ page. The audience for this page would be prospective or current students who have questions and/or are trying to find information. When reading the webpage from the student’s point of view, the student sees information in paragraphs that is logical and easily comprehended. There are bolded titles, green boxes with the Douglas logo, overall a concise list of answers that is a breeze to scroll through and find what they are looking for. From the programmer’s point of view, there are so many tedious symbols that have to go in a particular order and they read the web page in a way that will look logical from their perspective. Clearly each symbol, colour and letter needs to be in its specific spot or the final webpage will not be correct. Reading from the programmer’s perspective shows they have to apply their understanding of new knowledge to make their codes correct and then that will allow the codes to tell the browser how to read it and display the information properly.
Clearly from the programmer’s point of view, reading a webpage is a complicated task that must be done in a precise manner. It involves reading code which isn’t something that everyone understands. From the student’s point of view, rarely do they take into consideration all the codes that are present and needed to make the webpage exist, and often just read through like any other material.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I found that the code of the webpage Netflix was in black, blue, and red and the dominant colour was different for each section of writing. The coding takes away from the positive experience of a website. Websites are supposed to be easy to follow and appealing to the eye whereas the code is the opposite of that. Unless the reader has experience in computer programming, the decoding is impossible. Since the creator of Netflix wants a popular use of their website, they will change the appearance to be easily navigated by anyone. The website is full of pictures and few words to draw in the viewer and help them understand what is available to watch. By withholding the code, the user will be able to control the website with ease.
	I also tried to click on some of the links on the page with the code to find out where they connected. It was cool to see that the code is the same as the website but just has a different appearance. The pictures that are on the original Netflix page are just turned into code. As well, the links to the movies were hidden in the code. Some links connected to pages with just more code, which really shows the amount of work that had to be put into the design of the webpage. There were large spaces between the coding sections so I clicked on links in multiple sections and it seemed that the code was spaced out according to different categories on the webpage.
	The website is very organized and easy to use. On the home page there are categories of movies that can be scrolled through as well as a search bar and a browse tab for further searching.
	My take away from this module is that withholding information can change the appearance and appeal of a website like the POV in a novel can change the mood and the moral of the story.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The website I chose to analyze the code is Facebook. This online social media service has a simple to use setup that makes it easy for people to browse other profiles, exchange messages, post photos and status updates, share videos, etc all in one website. Its pretty crazy to think how hard it would be to make a setup to have all those different features work. Looking at the code gives me another perspective of how the website functions. The code seems to be sectioned with about three lines each I'm guessing for each different post. None of the words in these sections make sense to me, but I can see how each section represents each different post and allows the website to have a simple organized set up for its users to use. Seeing the amount of work it takes to allow Facebook users such as myself have straightforward quality experience makes me appreciate the long hours it must take to make these codes work so the website can function. The role that a coder has in having the user of the webpage receive the information clearly is critical. The coder for example with Facebook has to know how to communicate codes to the browser so that users of the website can use all the features distinctly. The coder must have to use the perspective of a user so they can organize to codes so the website can be displayed to both function and be appealing to use. 

With Mr. Penumbra’s 24 Hour Bookstore we can see the countless years of hard work it took members of the Unbroken Spine to attempt at deciphering the code. The story highlights the viewpoint of the coders in there struggle to attempt to solve this 500 year mystery. Clay’s “new knowledge” perspective allows him to solve the code through the use of modern technology to find the meaning behind the Manutius. This novel truly gives the readers the drudgery of coding and the amazing things that can be created from it.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[As I study the code of the Douglas College website it appears to be very complex and confusing. There is a section at the top where the "DOCTYPE" and "html class" is described. When I scroll over the html class the whole webpage becomes highlighted so that part must have to do with the programming of the text on the page. There are only a few English words in the coding; the majority of the code is letters jumbled together. In the bottom half of the code there are two main sections: one describing the element style which include colour and margin information and the other section includes an image of the layout of the webpage. It certainly does not add anything to help me understand the webpage in greater depth. If I was a computer programmer and had background knowledge I would be able to decipher, interpret and probably recognize the code.

The webpage is organized in such a way that the textual elements of the coding section are at the top and the elements of the text are at the bottom on the coding information. A typical webpage organizes itself with having a large title at the top to give the reader an idea of the topic. Then, usually, there are several subheadings that allow the reader to locate information in a more timely manner. The reader (audience) decodes the information on the webpage from their own perspective since information can be portrayed in different ways and can easily be misinterpreted. Since I picked a "Study at Douglas" webpage, the audience would likely be people who are thinking about becoming future students at Douglas College. The website designer and coder play a critical role in displaying the information on a webpage. If not coded properly, the reader could miss information or become confused if the information is not organized and laid out into readable, legible sections. Therefore, it is critical that the coder think as if he was looking at the webpage from a reader's point of view. 

Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore relates to the coding of a computer webpage. The member's of the Unbroken Spine have spent countless hours in an attempt to decode the Manutius. It isn't until Clay uses his new knowledge through the use of modern technology that this mystery is solved. Both coding for a webpage and coding of the Manutius takes a lot of tedious work that many people take for granted but when it is complete it sure is a creative work of art.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[When looking at the page source of CNN’s website, the code is incredibly overwhelming. You could say it assaults my poor retinas. The code spans the entire width of the page and continues down for a long while. In a way, my experience of the website is heightened, because like Michaela and DNO, I too have found a deeper appreciation for the hard work from the writers, programmers, coders, anyone involved in the creation of such quality work. I could imagine the production of one online story involves a process of collaboration that requires a lot care and meticulousness, while running on a tight schedule.

The coder’s perspective of how a website should look influences users to navigate the website in a certain way. The codes they formulate are essentially translated by the browser so that the user can receive the information in a particular way. They control how users take in the information by encoding it for both the user and the browser to understand. In a way, the coder is the middle man.

Within Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore, the adventures of Clay and the gang highlight the social conventions of coding and coders. For instance, Clay’s descriptions of utilizing Google’s book scanner and the software Hadoop to miraculously decode a codex plays on how many people view technology- that we all just throw things at Google and it will spit out an answer. The idea of Hadoop itself is extremely complex, beyond the understanding of millions of people, yet Kat gives a very plain explanation in order to keep the story simple for the reader. The book hides the level of expertise required to code and how hard coders work to produce encryptions, websites, or software like Hadoop, etc. I’ll admit, I have no idea of how coding is done, but can imagine that this kind of work requires more than a little brainpower and care.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The code just looks like jibberish to me, with the odd phrase or command thrown in. 

The webpage (Youtube) is set up like the typical video/media website. Content of the page is orgaized with the video at the centre, an account panel at the top right, navigation panel at the top, with related and suggested videos on the side. Youtube has a comments section aswell. 
The code was organized in massive blocks of text with characters such as "is.container).not('#priam_more_friends,.priam_friend_selected'):" 

and is broken up with sections of what seems like names for certain features or commands class="watch-secondary-actions yt-uix-button-group" data-button-toggle-group="optional"&gt;. I really have no clue.

In the menu on Netflix, there were no breaks in the sections. It was just one massive page of characters and text. 

When you "read" a page, you are reading commands from an Html Coder, that was written in code specifically for the page. The browser then takes this code, and then produces another code that we recognize as the user-interface and language. 

For example, a symbol going round and round on YouTube means "buffering". A triangle with the point facing to the right, means "Play". Two Vertical bars side by side indicates "Paused". 

Mr.Penumbras bookstore really does not relate to the technical level of coding at all, even when Clay was designing his virtual library. At most he just complained in his head about the difficulties, but it didn't show what went into writing code. 

Most likely the expectations of the audience was that they were not proficient in coding so they would not be able to appreciate the full level of monotony and repetitive hours that are involved in coding. 
Secondly, in terms of context, if a large majority of Clay's internal dialogue shifts to complaining about the negative aspects of coding and the technicalities of it ,the focus of conflict perhaps woudnt of been Old knowledge vs New Technology, but perhaps Clay vs Code. Being a first person narrative, this would greatly impact the context of the entire story.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[As I clicked on the page source for mmafighting.com the code popped up and there was an explosion of colourful symbols, letters, words, numbers, and links that never seemed to end. There were continuous lines, some broken up and some aligned. As I scrolled down the page it felt like I was in an action movie trying to diffuse a complicated bomb. It is amazing that a person could put all those numbers, letters and symbols together to create such a simple looking and user friendly website. Like others in the comment press I am impressed and have much more appreciation to those who are in the field that work with codes and developing programs and websites we see and use daily. The webpage is organized by a big title at the top of the page and then a bunch of videos and mma news articles as you scroll down the page. The videos and articles are also organized from the recent date being at the top page, while older dates are descending  as you scroll down the page. When I looked at both the code and the webpage I can see that some of words in the code match to where they are seen on the webpage. For example, on the code page the title “mmafighting” is right at the top and also on the top on the webpage. Organizing the webpage for readers to simply look at videos and articles in order from the most current date makes it efficient and simple for the readers to use since readers like me want to keep up to date with most current events. 

In Mr. Penumbra’s 24 hour bookstore we see that Clay uses his new knowledge to try and decode Manutius, this new knowledge includes using modern technology such as computers, scanners, and google. While members of the unbroken spine choose to use old knowledge which is having members read throughly. We see that the book itself is like a code to a webpage as the code is translated through a browser it shows up as more then words, numbers and symbols. Just like how one of the codex vitae was seen differently once decoded. In the end we see that it takes both new knowledge and old knowledge to solve the code, which shows the importance of both new technology but also still using old knowledge.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[For this module, I viewed multiple codes belonging to the websites that I visit frequently and I noticed some differences amongst them. Some websites, such as Facebook, seemed to have what looked like more ‘complex’ codes with numerous rows of mixed up letters, numbers and symbols, none of which were of any understanding to me. However, other websites such as Twitter or 8tracks had more blank space visible, perhaps indicating a simpler code. Our Digital Cultures Lab website was the easiest to comprehend in my opinion because the coding was not difficult to understand. The instructions, the comments and other information visible on the website were easily spotted in the code (as well as some hidden information). As a result of viewing the codes of different websites, the ‘WYSIWYG’ idea makes me realize how something so easy for many of us to use is an extremely well-put together and detailed piece of work done by individuals who not only tailor to the minds of the users, but that of the computer as well. 
Old knowledge versus new knowledge and how the mind processes information all depends on the point of view of a certain individual. Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore was narrated by Clay’s character and the readers experienced the story through his perspective. Clay’s personality, his above average knowledge of technology and the fact that he worked at the bookstore all played into his version of the adventure. If this same story was told through Kat’s POV, Penumbra’s POV, or even Corvina’s POV, the references to technology could have been more advanced, more focused on negative attempts or perhaps not even mentioned at all. Similarly, individuals who refrain from using new knowledge may not be able to comprehend something considered quite simple, such as Facebook, whereas those who understand how to maneuver their way around the internet may not know how to decipher a code. Regardless, what an individual considers to be old knowledge and new knowledge seem to be relative to their point of view.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[My level of familiarity with HTML Code (HyperText Markup Language) although very basic, gave me some understanding of what exactly I encountered for this module, to which was from the login page of myDouglas. In highscool I took an “Intro to Business Computers” course where we had to make our own coded website, something very simple and what Clay and Kat could likely achieve in a deep slumber.
 
Looking at the code itself, I notice the different tags, colours – black, blue, purple, red, if-then commands, and links to other pages that will occur with the click of the mouse on a certain symbol. There are series of commands that enable a webpage to display what it does and how it does; a surface layer so easy and trivial to navigate by users versus the complex codes on the deeper layers that make it what it is. The HTML code to me represents the dichotomy of old knowledge and new knowledge in Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore by Clay, being tech-savvy and capable of unlocking the code that the Unbroken Spine members spent tireless years slowly unfolding. The point of view coming from Clay’s character in the novel is someone that is innovative and looking for simpler ways of getting things done. Until late into the novel, the reader is led to believe that Mr. Penumbra falls directly on the opposite side of that spectrum, in my opinion to further contrast our initial preconceptions with what we see on the surface, versus what something actually is. 

The novel does a great job at mentioning truly complex concepts without steering off readers that may have no prior knowledge of. As Maxine (class member, I can do this right?) mentioned in her response, how Kat was able to give a simple explanation for the deep and layered concept of Hadoop. Examples like this, and how for instance Clay coded and stated frustrations that came with the codes, without providing anything too technical that the average reader and non-coder wouldn’t understand. Had there been more complex ideas coming from Clay, it might have taken away from the context of the story itself, since it was a first-person narrative. As a reader we were not too concerned with the actual coding behind Clay’s work, but rather the outcome that occurred as a result of it, much like the experience with a webpage.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[For this module, I viewed the source for the front page of www.cimorellimusic.com. The first impression that I got was, "Wow, this is nowhere near as colourful or neat as the page I was just on. The source page is just a bunch of random words in different colours with a couple words from the front page everyone sees, on the code page. It doesn't really add anything to my experience on the website, just confuses me a little bit, but I could appreciate the amount of work that it takes to develop a page that seems so simple. 

Everything is placed into categories, for example: the youtube videos for the Cimorelli band are all placed together on the source page, and it is all colour-coded. The underlying principles behind the organizing system is that everything that is of similar code are grouped together so when viewers view the actual webpage, everything will be there neatly for them to view. I believe the website developer develops the codes, and a computer system program automatically deciphers the code, though this, I am not 100% sure. 

The role a coder plays in website developing is massive. Even if a computer system program does decipher the code, the coder would still have to provide the program the codes to crack, otherwise there is nothing there for the computer program. Viewing the source page, it also tells us how the coder wanted the viewers to view the website in a certain way, for example: grouping the Youtube videos together, so that provides easy access for the viewers if they are trying to locate the Youtube videos for the band. Looking at the source page, you are able to tell that it takes a series of hard work to develop a website that is easy-to-use for regular computer users just visiting the website, and also makes it that the viewers do not have to look at the source page to find what they are looking for, as that will make it difficult for the average computer user, very quickly. 

This is relatable to Mr. Penumbra's 24 Hour Bookstore is how we are told very simply, how Clay develops his virtual library, and how Kat explains how the the program Hadoop, and Google's Book Scanner works, but in a dumb-founded way so that the readers can understand plainly, when in reality, the process, programs, and technology used to achieve such things can be greatly confusing. The same can be found when viewing the source codes for the front page for www.cimorellimusic.com. Out front, we see a webpage that is easy to navigate and use, but inside, there are multiple series of commands, strange symbols such as, "( ), ," etc., and different words and sentences in multiple colours. For something to be made, there is always a series of hard work, and confusing steps that must be taken to achieve such a great work. 

When we are reading books and other things, we only pay attention to the things that stand out to us, and don't really pay much attention or thought to the things that seem minor. In Mr. Penumbra's 24 Hour Bookstore, we are given a brief description on how the Google Book Scanner operates, but never a full in-depth explanation, because it is not necessary for the story to advance. But a small explanation does help, that we can relate this to this module. What we see on the outside is nice and easy-to-use, but if we go in deeper into the source codes, it becomes confusing quickly. So, if we just take a quick look at a source code page, we can gather some of the things on it, but most of it will just fade away. And, this helps us to understand what we are viewing, and where the things we view can be found.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I chose to view the coding for the National Hockey League website, as it is one I visit often, and I was surprised to find the equivalent of many pages of coding. This really goes to show how much work it takes to create a website and organize it as desired.
 	Although, the immense amount of coding can come across as overwhelming and complicated at first glance, if you take the time to actually read it, you can start to see how it relates to the website. For example, in the coding of nhl.com, you can see the thirty different NHL teams organized alphabetically. Compared to the coding, the website is far more simple to read and understand, and everything is properly organized into their respective sections making it very easy to navigate the site. To those who are unfamiliar with computers, the coding could seem like an entire new language due to its technical layout of writing.
	Clearly, coders have to be very thorough when designing a website to ensure optimal usage for visitors. Even just one little mistake could ruin the whole intended layout of the website, as every different section of the page must be correctly linked to its proper next section that should appear after been clicked on. Now when I will read this webpage again in the future, I will be more thankful for the ease of reading that is provided for me and anyone else who uses this website. This is thanks to computers, who will understand coding better than humans ever will. 
	The coding in this website, and many other website relates to Mr. Penumbra’s 24 Hour Bookstore, because in the book, Clay has to decode the codex, and to do so, must count on help from Kat and her team at Google, who require advanced technology in order to do so. This affirms the complexity behind coding, and goes to show the reliance that many people have for computers to make things easier to understand for them.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I went to http://www.buzzfeed.com/ and the source code looks very organized and spaced out just as the website itself. There were a lot of repetition such as “meta name” and “fb” and I could see how it connects with the web page since there are so many face book icons. It does add to my experience of the website because some codes look familiar to me, I used to work with html when I used to have my own blog. For example, the kind of text buzzfeed is using as its font, linking their site to social media such as Facebook and twitter. The webpage organizes itself by using symbols (, =), inserting contents (fonts, pictures, icons) into the website and also colour coding them. A web designer/some one who works with codes does the deciphering and from their point of view, these codes have to look “logical” as michaela said because they worked with codes and are expected to know and understand them. From reading a web page, the role of a coder has a lot of responsibilities in order for the viewers to receive information on a website. As many said, this would take hours to write down all the codes. Looking at the buzzfeed website, codes are arranged in a specific location, insert every links, remember all the codes so objects would show up on the web page and make sure the codes are written correctly. It is very tedious work because one error on the code would make a huge change on the web page (recalling from my own experience when I was working on my blog). As well, since we are constantly using social media, coders in this web page and many news-related webpages have to recode/update the webpage. 
Mr Penumbra’s 24 Hour Bookstore does highlight to conventions of coding and coders. Clay and his friends are off to an adventure of finding the code to immortality and while finding it, the uses of technology like Google even fails to find the code, which means coding is a very complex process. Just like this lab, the source code of the browser is difficult to understand so coders have to work really hard in order for us to receive information on the webpage.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I've been using the internet for so many years now and up until now, it never occurred to me how websites are set up to look presentable and legible to the users. The webpage I decided to look at is our class website: digitalcultureslab.ca. It's amazing to see how certain commands and characters can give the website its unique look. Command functions such as  or  </a> and codes I can't understand,  is basically the soul of every webpage. I say this because without them, websites would be dead and plain. To me, and to those who are illiterate in programming, this is a whole new language—computer language. The website also contain links in which directs users if clicked on to other pages. The new link contains its own unique codes and commands.

While contemplating on the complex backbone of the website, I realized a similarity in Mr. Penumbra's 24 hour bookstore and websites. I realized that the books were organized/coded in a certain way, just like how websites are coded in certain ways to produce a decipherable outcome, to shape users' and viewers' perspectives. Because Clay is a programmer, a coder, he is used to seeing patterns. This gave him the idea to examine or observe the bookstore's customers closely. Having done this, he saw an interesting pattern which helped him solve the code with the help of his computer.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I chose to compare two websites on their source info. I chose to use Tumblr and Google as my websites, although we were told to avoid using Google, even the source code of such a simple website was confusing and long. However, when I went on Tumblr for its source code I then realized how small the Google was in comparison due to tumblr having a continuous amount of content/posts. Nevertheless, both sites contained codes that look confusing unless read closely, and then I am able to pick up certain words that are familiar. Although, the websites have codes that look similar to me, they are organized with different structures and colours, Google has mostly black coloured font compared to tumblr that was mostly blue coloured font. Tumblr also has characters right at the top of the page source in green, that spell out the word tumblr; this is not similar for most other sites I visited such as Facebook or the Douglas library. 

The comments above suggest the code as the question and the websites as the answer to the code, therefore this code reminds me of an algebra equation. The code is similar to the equation can only be understood from the point of view of someone who is familiar with its language. If someone does not know much about calculus has to view an algebraic equation, then it will seem just as complicated as the source code for the pages. In that sense I can understand how the different point of views affect what people see, since my mother would most likely view my calculus as how I view the page source code.

The programmers of the websites have to be very meticulous in their work since one small mistake can result in a completely different answer like some math equations or without an answer at all, like the codex in Mr. Penumbra’s 24 hour book store. As the previous comments have suggested if it was not for Clay’s new knowledge he would not have solved the Codex, but having access to old knowledge also helped him solve the code. As Kat had used just new knowledge to solve it and she was unable to. So I think it is similar to the programmers as they would probably need to know new knowledge as well as the old to properly function the sites.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I chose to look at the Douglas College webpage. The code looks very organized. There are lots of different numbers and letters that seem to line up to make a certain pattern on the webpage. The colors are black, blue and red. The black seems to highlight a heading of the page, whereas the red highlights key words in webpage code. The blue words are the most present in the code as they are mostly letters and numbers that don’t make much sense. The code is very spaced out and allows the reader to interpret the webpage much easier than a compressed paragraph. 

The experience of reading a webpage is very different than reading the webpage code. There initial webpage that a common user may view is much easier to read and to interpret. Whereas the code for the webpage is much harder to decipher. The role of a coder’s perspective on the website may be very different than a common user as the coder will look to see how organized the code is set up. If the code is organized, the coder will find the website to be more pleasant than a creative webpage with a messy code. 

Mr. Penumbra’s bookstore highlights the importance of coding throughout the book. The book that the members of the “cult” chose to write about was filled with different codes to figure out the member’s life. Each book that was written was organized by a code just like the headings on the webpage were organized by a code. The members of google also highlighted the importance of coding and decoding through their computer technology. The computers were able to pick out and decipher the codes in the book that Clay scanned from the secret library.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The first website I chose to check out was the Douglas College homepage, the first thing I noticed was that it had columns numbered from 1-871. It all looked like a bunch of gibberish to me, something I don't understand nor have I ever really thought about. The main colours of the code were green, black, blue and dark purple. The blue corresponded to links of any kind that were available, and the rest of the colours were organized in a way I couldn't decipher because I am not a programmer, or know much about technology in general. I noticed how precise it must all have had to be in order to come together so well. 
  The second webpage I decided to look at, in comparison was YouTube, which is a much larger, more advanced site by the looks of the source code. For instance there are 3449 columns for YouTube, the dominant colours were black, and blue for links again I would assume? Then bits of purple.
 Speaking from my personal experience I don't think many of us put a lot of thought into the pages we visit and the countless, tedious hours spent behind the scenes making it (depending on how advanced the site is) We read/scroll through and from my perspective, for the most part everything I went to the site for is there, well organized. Then again, from a programmers or coders perspective they probably take a closer look at sites, even with habit and can likely point out errors or ways they would have made it differently. They can read and understand the codes whereas I am completely clueless. 
 Mr. Penumbra's Bookstore highlights the importance of both old knowledge vs. new knowledge. The new knowledge like Google's book scanners did the work for you, quickly getting the answers we were looking for. While the members of the Unbroken Spine decoded the books themselves, which is much more time consuming and takes much more knowledge than we credit for. We prefer new knowledge but it's important to maintain all the old knowledge because without it, Clay wouldn't have been able to solve the codex. It is equally important to be able to enjoy the new knowledge, and appreciate the old knowledge.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[For this assignment, I decided to view and analyze my twitter homepage’s source code. (https://twitter.com/) When I clicked “View source” on my homepage, a minimized page popped up. The first thing I noticed on the page was a bunch of numbered lines of writing all in different colors made up of red, green, blue and black and because I am no computer genius, I was wondering why there was different colors in this code and if the colors had a different meaning to them. I felt like Clay when he first opened one of the coded books in Penumbra’s bookstore and didn’t have a clue what they meant. Whoever designed this website did an excellent job coding it because the codes look very intricate, organized and extremely long -containing 9053 lines-; also, from experience there is usually no glitches on the website and it is very popular as well. The second thing I notice was that some of the red words in the first section were in different languages (ex. ۜ۞-۪ۨ-ۯۺ-ۼۿݐ) and maybe this code was designed so that people from different countries could use this social media website in their own langue. There was also two words in blue that kept reappearing as I scrolled down: Function and Return; I wondered why these words were used so often, maybe they were key words that represented something on the website. 
The process of reading this source code was difficult because I seriously have no idea what these phrases, colors and symbols meant and I never thought about how a website works and gets created until this assignment. It is interesting to see the difference of my twitter homepage, as I have always seen it and then the codes that put the website together and make it function. In conclusion, the point of view differs from the users and the coders. The users see a nice blue twitter page with a bunch of random tweets from different people and the coders see a long list of symbols and phrases in different colors that makes the website run.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I chose the Reddit.com and Tumblr.com source codes to look at for this module. They were very different from each other, Reddit had 13 very long lines of code, which looked deceptively simple and happy until I "wrapped" the long lines of text to fit within the text box margins. I looked it up and it's written in a language called Python, which is supposed to be designed to be a simple, forthright and readable type of language. Obviously for people with experience in writing or reading code, which is not me. I think it's probably a very wordy source code in this case, because the whole point of the website is sharing links or text, voting them up or down with a "karma" system, and talking about them. If it were a primarily video or image focused website, then the code would look a lot different. (also as soon as I opened the source code viewer I automatically said TLDR - too long didn't read - to myself) Generally the code gave me the same impression I got of the user-end of the website when I first started using it, very wordy and it takes a bit of time to get use to the organization because my only other experience with website codes was when I dabbled in HTML when I was a youngin'. 
The Tumblr dashboard source code was a more visually appealing source code to look at. They even arranged 8's o's and other letters and characters to make a text art version of their website name at the top of the page. I don't have to scroll down very far and I see some notes that the designers left about tagging queries that I would never have known exist if it hadn't been for this assignment. In comparison to Reddit, Tumblr uses about 1080 lines in their code and a lot more symbols than letters and recognizable words. Both sites are based around sharing links, text and images, but they take very different approaches in their code. 

I think that it's an interesting choice to reveal Penumbra as an ex-computer whiz closer towards the end of the book, because it retro-actively gives some insight into how he might be thinking and reasons why he does things in contrast to the rest of the members of the Unbroken Spine. His office in the book store with all those piles of books and papers and other items are kind of like the source code that shows how he thinks and he himself is the user interface end of Penumbra, so to speak. 
After thinking about this for a day or two, I've thought of some parallels to experience in my life between Penumbra and my dad. My dad had a study (the basement) that was very like Penumbra's office, piles of books and papers with random old computers... I knew he had a way of organizing it, but it was never quite apparent to me from just looking at it. He was very interested in math (had a phd in it), logic and philosophy... and every once in a while he'd boot up his old Commodore 64 and write little programs. Yet he was never really interested in the new desktop computer my sister had, but it could have just been that he got a bit left-behind and caught up in his projects. 

I hope that wasn't too wordy and that I actually somewhat hit the point of this exercise..]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[For this assignment, I went on tsn.com as it is a website I quite often browse. When I right-clicked and viewed page sources, I came across a bunch of codes written on different lines. From looking at these codes, it seems a lot of hard work is put in to creating different webpage’s. In my point of view, it seems creating a website takes up a good chunk of labor. The different codes and texts give out the reaction that creating a website is not just a straightforward task. The vast amount of codes is used to develop the structure and layout of the website. The codes show us what we see on the website.  
	The coder’s perspective is very important in how we receive information. As Michaela commented, it involves reading code which most people might not understand. If we type something in Google, we expect to receive information on that topic. A person with general knowledge of Google will know how to use its functions. However, if they try to take a look at the webpage’s codes, they most likely will not have knowledge on what the codes mean. My “experience” was similar in this pattern as I did not know what any of the codes on the tsn.com webpage meant. Furthermore, it was my first time seeing codes for a website. The coder’s perspective is crucial as they determine what we see on a website or what we click on. If a code has an error, we might not see things properly on a website. For example, the layout and structure could all be screwed up. The coder can cause a big fumble if the codes are not done correctly. 
	People have such a reliance on the internet to find information. Without the internet, information on certain subjects would be difficult to come by. The coder plays a very important role in how we receive information on the computer. They help us gain fast and easy access to knowledge. In my point of view, it requires a vast amount of skill and know-how to create codes for websites properly.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[After clicking on the source view for the Digital Cultures website and National Geographic website all visuals were shown as their codes: basically a bunch of letters, numbers and symbols all organized to tell the computer to output what visual. The symbols majorly used were the “/” “[ ]” “ ‘ ‘ “ and “=”. The organization of the coding for the website looks at first glance in almost paragraph form, with lines of coding almost a half a page long. The links for picture images also follow to another page of coding, which when I found out I found myself thinking ‘a picture really is worth a thousand words’ as I was scanning the gibberish on the page. From the codes there’s not much I can decipher, but from the groupings and the general positioning on the page I can assume which parts of the webpage they code for.  

I worked two years ago editing the Douglas College Athletics Homepage, updating scores and photos and adding schedules, but that was nothing like the coding shown on those webpages. The only part of that job that relates to this would have to be the navigation of the site by the URL. Basically it was laid out as a general URL, but the numbers within the ending of the URL determined which team page you were taken to and the year. For example if at the end of the URL I entered “3/3/” that would have taken me to Softball, 2013’s page. This has lead me to pay more attention to the URLs used in majority of sites, trying to find shortcuts in navigation.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[After looking through several different website codings, I stumbled upon Facebook. The original source of the page was full of colourful (blue, black, red, and green) letters, numbers, and symbols all jumbled into a seemingly huge mess. I thought it was interesting that for an individual trained in website design and coding, they would easily be able to read and understand their meanings. However, from my point of view, it was as hopeless as looking at the scribbles of a completely foreign language, unable to translate it into my own. Although, I did spot numerous words that actually made sense- such as different links on the facebook page and etcetera. 

I thought of the original source page as a kind of “behind the scenes” to the actual webpage. It was as though the site is designed to be a glamourous facade, hiding the mess of symbols that created it. Most websites are designed to appear simple and easy to navigate through, however the codes show that the work that had gone into the website was quite the opposite. It goes to show you that something seeming so simple can have such a complex and intricate background that only some understand. Few people think about this when they quickly scroll through pages and pages of social networks or news articles. It requires so little effort to use a website and make no acknowledgement of its inner workings.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Expanding on the "behind the scenes" analogy, I wanted to add that the coding of a website would be to Clay from Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore, for example, as the makings of a movie would be to a producer. What I mean is when the average person watches a movie, they don't think about how the movie is made, the score, or how each shot was planned. From their perspective, It is only a story. However, when an individual who studies filmography watches a movie, they will notice the difficulty of each scene and the steps that were taken for it's completion. Similarly, a website designer like Clay notices aspects of a webpage that the average person would not give a second glance. They understand how it was created and the effort that was put into it's making.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I do a lot of online shopping so it was a no brainer which website I was going to look at. For this module, I choose the JustFab.ca website which is an online store selling women’s clothes, purses and what they are most importantly known for are shoes!!! The webpage was designed to be girly and eye catching with the main theme colours of hot pink, black and white. The theme colours are important in a web design because it catches the interest of the online shoppers to further explore the website and to look at the different products.  

The content of the page is organized by having the title of the company in the middle in the very top, bolded in hot pink and black font, and all in capital letters. On the top right is an account login for new and returning customers. Below the title of the company are six sub-headings; home, top sellers, our story, press &amp; celebs, VIP membership and getting started, allowing customers to easily identify what they are looking for. At the very bottom of the webpage has the contact information of the company. The whole web layout is very organized and clear. 

Behind this very girly, fun, and colour website, it is coded into different words and symbols. For example just the top of the webpage indicating the title is :

 JustFab

Looking at the different codes and words it all looks gibberish to me. Each word corresponds to a purpose allowing the webpage to come together. Having one letter or word in the in incorrect spot could mess up the the overall layout of the website. From the programmer’s point of view, the webpage needed to be catchy, simple yet girly to attract customers from the moment the webpage loaded. After seeing the web design from the surface and seeing it in symbols, reminded me there is more than one perspective and not everything is all glamorous. This is important to remember because to truly understand a story, a problem, a situation...etc. all perspectives must be taken into account.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The code is a language created for computers in order to form an image which creates the website. Several commands gathered together form the code, which presents the coded language to a readable image on the screen to the observer.   The code behind the face of the website does not really change the experience with the website itself, other than to those who have experience with website creation. The web page organizes itself with the type of website it is and sets up the image of the page. The title and subtitle links follow and as the coding continues down the page the seen contents of the page for the viewer are written into the code.

The form of this code converts the computers inputted language into one that is visible to everyone as a written human language on a web page instead of as the computers language. Reading is done by both the computer and the human viewing the web page. The computer reads the code by understanding a language that has been created by computer programmers for the computer to relay as another image on the screen. The way the computer programmer inputs the language can reflect personal preference and taste. This changes the perspective and point of view of the web page because of the creator’s tastes and companies tastes are inputted into the site. Much like an author to a book the creator hides text and connections. Within Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore, there was an element of both coding by the author with hiding messages and connections. There is also physical coding of the books within the store.

There is a pattern to the way in which Mr. Penumbra’s bookstore is organized. The books that have the codes for the Unbroken Spine members are stored in the back of the bookstore where the normal books that everyone can read are at the front. The books at the back follow a similar structure to the way that websites are written due to the fact that rules to the language is known only to those who have written or programmed it.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I analyzed both Tumblr and our Digital Cultures Lab source sites and found letters and numbers that are foreign language to me at first sight, compared to the simplicity the websites show us. Tumblr consists of about 400 and more lines containing the codes for the website: blue hyperlinks or letters that are in colour purple and sometimes red text. Interestingly enough, I have a little bit of old knowledge with programming websites since I took a Technology class when I was in high school back in the Philippines. I remember that you always (or usually) end the coding of the website with “” or start and type any text with this “&lt;” symbol, also keywords head, title, footer. I remember having to make our own website as a final project which took a lot of time and attention to complete; placing hyperlinks for a specific colour or background you chose, the amount of text you would like your reader to see or the information you enter in your site. The amount of work was absolutely ridiculous. One simple error perhaps a wrong symbol that you finish your code with, completely changes the look of your website. Essentially, what we see from the surface is always different from what is actually being shown to us. Interestingly enough with my old knowledge with this, I found the answers from our quiz today (and some other stuff) from the source page off our class’ website. The perspective of knowing what was behind the making of these websites, completely changes my attitude towards how everything was made, similar as to how I viewed the novel Penumbra’s 24 Hour Bookstore. I always wondered what was going on in the minds of authors making or creating their stories. Questions such as ‘did this happen to him in real life?’ or ‘how did he come up with this idea?’ would come up to my mind whenever I read a novel. The author, Robin Sloan, must have so much knowledge that he is suppressing from what he actually experienced or thought when he was writing this novel. The amount of information hidden in the website’s source must be how much Robin Sloan is hiding from us. The programmer, similar to Robin Sloan, is the main knowledge provider to when we use such websites or read the novel. Thus, knowledge whether old or new with the source of a website or novel completely depends on how you see things; on what your perspective truly is.  Clearly from my perspective, my understanding of the novel is that it’s trying to imply to us, the digital age community, that new knowledge such as computers is not the answer to everything but the answer is within ourselves, as cliché as that sounds.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I searched some image codes like HTLM,QR and  WP  it have plenty of symbols, numbers, letters in different fonts and sizes  and short words arranged in certain order. Some codes look like pieces of art and others like puzzle; for instant, Morse code it’s contains letters or numbers  and beside each line of dots and dashes. To me these cods are hard to understand and complicated but I enjoy the images. Searching and reading about codes makes me appreciate and value more computer programmers work and creativity by develop codes  and break it down for machines like computers to understand and help to create apps and website.  I chose CTV News website to study. The website is well organized so user can easily locate the information they are searching. The home page organizes by the CTV News logo at the side of the page with strong colors like blue, white, red and green. under the title there are icons specify the news like icon for resent news, local news and news program and each one lead to more specific news and the web site is full of  newest news videos . Also to make users feel included and connected they make it possible for people to share by adding links to social media like twitter and Face book.  The code for the website is consisting of some recognizes words, symbols, letters and lots of links. It is very huge code reflects the effort taken to develop the website and make it easier for user.  It was my first time reading or searching about code and this experience give me some knowledge about how code helps to organize and layout what we see in the screen it’s like a writing tool in computers]]></wp:comment_content>

Why is it important we prefer methods that are not time consuming?
Why is it important the maintain old knowledge?
I think we need to maintain old knowledge because technology today is too one sided. We need old knowledge to fill in the flaws of modern technology.
I mean look at this.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[After looking at the thousands of lines of code required to make an interactive webpage, with various drop down menus, for example, it becomes clear how much work goes into making such a web page. As someone with little to no knowledge of programming, this is something I was relatively unaware of.  A coder puts in hard work in writing the code so that the user can have a simple and easy to navigate experience. The programmer is the person that dictates what your website experience will be like and the code is the structure of the user experience. Individual differences from person to person, as well as cultural differences, would dictate how the code is structured and how that would change the user's experience of a web page. Therefore, other countries that use different domains that those we are familiar with, could have web pages that are unfamiliar, less appealing and more difficult to navigate.
The actual level of technical expertise required to code is something that is lost on many people. That is why Mr. Penumbra's bookstore never goes into great deal about the actual process of coding, unlike The Bug. This helps to keep the theme of technology more interesting and exciting to the majority of readers, by focusing on the users experience rather than on the structure of coding.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[For the module, the website source i am using is the current Digitalcultureslab.ca. Unlike Youtube or Instagram, the source of this page is less mumbo jumbo to me. It is a website mostly designed for us to comment on.Therefore, the source is simple compared to those multifunctional websites such as Facebook or Snapchat.

I looked into the lines and tried to understand a little using basic programming skills that i learnt long ago. It actually brings me back memories of me studying programming. Our instructor was nerdy but strict, zero tolerance to mistakes. A website is combined with a lot of simple functions and orders. It's not like computers today can understand a lot more complicated commands. They are just faster at solving huge amount of tasks, and each task links to one another. A mistake or "bug" might jeopardize the whole program which is build up with time and effort. And finding the "bug" is even more difficult. Just like the codes for the Unbroken Spine members, they follow a similar way as website sources. It is systematic, and the progress is time and effort consuming. On the other hand, decoding requires the same.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[After looking at a couple websites that I frequently go to, I decided to also compare Google’s coding. I noticed that Google’s coding has no use of white space or indentation. It is all jumbled up together and it’s mostly all black. Whereas, if you look at Youtube or Craiglist, they use a lot of white space to allow you to easily identify which section bellows to which coding. They also have red, green, and blue in the coding. I guess it represents the hyperlink or special codes that make up the website. If you look at Craiglist, they have a lot of sections and hyperlinks that lead you to different categories. One could see the resemblance from the website to the coding because it has a lot of indentation to show when each section starts. To be honest, it looks like gibberish to someone who does not understand the language code of HTML and CSS. Since one cannot understand the mastermind behind the coding, they begin to appreciate the creation and structure of a website – whether it be simple or complex. Although Google is a simple website, the coding is very difficult to follow. Looking at the codes allowed me to realize that there is a lot more than meets the eye to a website. If I place the codes on one half of my screen, and the website on the other half, I can slightly follow along to identify which code belongs to which structure or format on the website. In addition, I found that the more line space and indentation there are (when a new code starts), the easier it is to follow or read. It makes it easier on the eyes; whereas, with Google, it is a pile of letters slammed into a document with no organization or structure.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Ashley! I totally agree with you when you mentioned your takeaway from this module. I didn't know how to put what I was thinking into words, but its true, information can change the appearance and appeal to something that we all may like (which sucks but sometimes for the best) just like the POV in a novel can change the mood/moral of the story, how we view a character, or our opinion of a whole book.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The first website I went to was my Twitter account and I really didn’t understand any of it, it looked like a foreign language to me (ie. ۞-۪ۨ-ۯۺ-ۼۿݐ-ݿࢠࢢ-). I tried to read through the page source, I managed to pick out a couple words here and there but there were a lot of symbols and words I didn’t understand. For experienced “decoders” I think would be able to grab more from codes just because they know/understand what certain words, symbols, phrases mean. I noticed that when you scroll quickly up and down there is a pattern on the left part of the screen that looks like a squiggle all the way up and down the page. I went to the Douglas Library website as well to compare and they all were different but had the same criteria. There was a column on the left side of the page (1-970 on the Douglas Library site), there was different text colors such as orange, green, black, blue, and purple. The difference between the Douglas Library site and others was that there were actual links highlighted in blue you could click on. Once I opened a link it just sent me to another page source full of codes, which were all structured and organized. It was interesting to see a page with images, links, information etc. translated into “code”. I don’t think the page source adds anything to my experience personally because I don’t understand what everything means. In the book Clay and his friends are computer geniuses and lived for unraveling codes so for some people who find codes really neat, I think it’s great but for me I don’t understand how it works but maybe who knows, maybe I could be like Penumbra and find it fascinating once it’s explained to me. Thinking back to the book I can see how difficult and frustrating it would be to pick through and sort out codes without the help of a computer or machine but the had the tools, resources, and patience whereas I think people growing up in the "technology era" lack in some of those areas, we rather get it done the fastest/easiest way.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I decided since nearly everyday I am looking at my blackboard account keeping upto date on all my courses, that I would check out the page source for their website. When I first looked at it there were a few spots where I could pick out words that made a bit of sense to me but when you look at it as a whole none of it made much sense. It all looked so foreign to me since I have no experience in creating web pages and any sort of computer programming. I then started trying my best to piece together the lines of the page sourcing and tried deciphering what it says. Certain lines I could tell were the links to the specific classes, or the notification portion. I also noticed that specific words were colour coded but I am not sure why they are since you can't click on them and it doesn't take you to an external link. Maybe it was a way for the programmer to sort everything out and find the main parts quicker? 

I now realize that there is a lot of effort that gets put into creating a website - a lot more than I thought. I do know from some friends who have designed websites that even if one comma is in the wrong place that it can throw off the entire webpage and you can see it differently. After looking at the page source, it didn't really change my perspective on the webpage that I was on. It made me realize that even though the page is easy to navigate there must of been a ton of effort that was put into it without me realizing it, so it was neat being able to see a glimpse of what was behind the making of the webpage, even if I didn't understand it.

In Penumbra's 24 hour bookstore, Clay gives a bit of a brief description about different software programs but he never goes into much detail. The first gave us a general idea, just enough to show the new way of searching for things and encoding and decoding which help paint a better picture of the book. If it had gone into more detail I don't think I would of liked the book as much.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The internet is a vast and mysterious place but the site I visit most frequently as it is my go- to place is “https://www.netflix.com“. The code itself begins with a lot of gaps and simple “internet language” as it makes up bits and pieces of the website, as I proceed down to observe the codes it descends into a something much more complicated. Some words are blue and some are mahogany, when you keep scrolling you come to see a series of numbers making up important information and data. Nothing really adds to my experience from the codes but I do have a new found fascination for website designers as it is a tricky job to make sure the presentation is up to par with the brand. The webpage is neatly organized in a series of movie/ TV show windows with a quick summary of the plot if you hover over the box with your mouse. The underlying principle is to ensure web browsers have a smooth experience with the website and are completely satisfied with the navigation aspect.  The decipher is the webpage designer and simply brings ideas to life, it is important to view the page from a browsers perspective as it is very crucial for a simple viewing experience as it always guarantees satisfaction. An HTML coder dictates your viewing privileges as much as they please, they have the power to change certain aspects of a site and change your whole experience with internet surfing. In the novel  “Mr. Penumbra’s 24 hour book store” by Robin Sloan, it heavily highlights the importance of how old and new knowledge are to different generations and how forms of knowledge is merely a POV. There are just some things that you need old and new knowledge for, it’s important to have an understanding of both and to know when to use the two. For example, Clay solved the mystery of the Manutius in a day while others using old knowledge have been struggling to produce an answer, this shows that new knowledge should not be underestimated and it shows that sometimes new isn’t always bad. I believe that the novel has a metaphor for the people of the “Unbroken Spine”, they are the back bone of old knowledge just like how Kat is part of the back bone of Google .]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Essay Review Module</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Instructions:</strong> <em>Due for Feb. 4, 2015 class.</em> This module is about helping you understand where your writing needs improvement by looking at the work of others. The idea here is to recognize and avoid the errors that lead to poorly executed essays in the draft stage before it counts.

<strong>Summary:</strong>

<strong>Task:</strong> As we discussed in class, you should comment on at least three of the rough drafts submitted online to the class website.

<strong>What should should I be commenting on?</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Does the rough draft make sense? If it does, how? If not, how not?</li>
	<li>Does the rough draft address the question? If so, how? If no, how?</li>
	<li>What would you change?</li>
	<li>Are there transitions, is there a logic?</li>
	<li>Is the subject narrow enough; can the essay really get at the details?</li>
	<li>Does the rough draft appear to include "things"; real details to discuss, clarify, and define? What are they?</li>
	<li>Syntactical or grammatical errors</li>
</ul>
<strong>Outcomes</strong>:
<ul>
	<li>How does looking at the work of someone else help you write better?</li>
	<li>How can you apply the process of editing some else's work to your own?</li>
	<li>What could you take from the example to make your writing better?</li>
</ul>
<strong>Takeaways</strong>:
<ul>
	<li>Essay writing is all about the craft of editing. If you do not spend time editing and shaping the essay, it will suffer.</li>
	<li>Watch your assumptions. Taking into account the assumptions you make about what your audience understands is key both to developing a relevant subject for your essay and for writing an essay that accounts for its audience.</li>
	<li>Writing essays is not something you do for your instructor. In fact, it's about writing well because you have something you think might be interesting to someone; anyone.</li>
	<li>Take account of your process. What do you need to change about the way you approach essays? If you didn't implement those changes, but know that you need to change something, ask yourself what's up with that and take steps to address it.</li></ul>

<strong>Here's a list of the drafts:</strong>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The setting has a tremendous affect on what happens in the story. When the story is contextualized, the reader gains a perspective and sense of where the plot might be headed. When it comes to understanding the plot of a story, the setting often plays an important role. A stories setting is more than just a backdrop of the plot. It often plays an important role in developing the stories events and themes. While not all stories develop their settings, some evoke vivid associations of particular times or places. In order to contextualize the plot, the reader’s engagement, and the clear development in the setting is crucial. The setting serves as much more than a mere vehicle to cement readers in the time and place within the story. It is a psychological force upon how we understand. In modern stories, the setting stands as an influence that helps readers sense what is happening with the characters. The grasp of the plot keeps people engaged more and more. This means that the reader is fascinated or immersed into the story. Before soaking up the story, a compelling setting is what hooks readers into the narrative. Being engaged in the narrative will keep the reader flipping through the pages for hours on end. The select setting of the narrative is what keeps the reader thinking and visualizing. The development of the setting is also very important if we are to truly be enticed by the story. The careful construction of the setting will present the readers with what they are getting into. The structure of the setting has the potential to escalate, or potentially de-escalate the narrative. In order for the storytelling to be effective, the setting should provide a backdrop that is both cognitively and emotionally compelling. A good example of this would be the development of mood and tension. A stories mood and tension is one of the aspects that consumes the readers mind. The development of these atmospheres builds into the reader’s interest, or disinterest. These are just a few ways the setting can be contextualized. The reader’s engagement in the narrative and the clear development of the setting influences how we understand.]]></content:encoded>

In fact, there's no mention of what book you're dealing with in here. What is the focus of the essay? It better not be "setting" alone because that's far too general. There needs to be far more detail and specifics, a few references to either <em>Penumbra</em> or <em>The Bug</em> depending on which you decide to use are essential. Right now what you have is an encyclopedia entry without a lot of analysis about how setting works in one of the novels we have read so far.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I would add for the rest of you: thanks to Aaron for getting this started. It's a great example of how you should NOT be writing. This draft violates almost every bit of advice I have given you about writing in class:

- address details not generalized terminology--name the setting, don't just write setting--what colour is your cat?
- move from the specific details out into more generalized claims, not the other way around, like this does. No detail at all. Just what you would read in a dictionary. Common knowledge.
- Don't teach your reader. I know all about setting. What I want you to show me is how you think the setting--whatever you think it is--is working in the book. What's it doing? How does it work? 
- I could ask "so what" about EVERY sentence in here. That means every sentence in this example is a potential ESSAY. Not just part of a paragraph on setting, but the basis for an entire essay
- do not waste time contextualizing "setting" as a term. If I taught you what the term means, assume I know all about it basically. I can google it. What I want to know is what you think the setting is ad why that's important for understanding the book as a comment on a cultural moment. What does the setting say about our current fascination with technology? Answer that and you might have something, if you tell me what the setting is--google? Bookstore? Clay's brain? The codex? Clay's car? The airplane? 
- THING THING THINGS!!!! STUFF!! EXAMPLES!!!

You all owe Aaron a great deal for getting this outta the way. There's plenty of time to fix things.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[You should stick with the past tense in your essay, because this will make your writing smoother and easier to read. You should also avoid using the word “we”, you have used it three times.

The setting has an effect not affect, because the setting has changed the story it is not changing the story, and due to the fact that the novels we have read are both past tense. If you would like more about this, check out: http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/affect-versus-effect. 

I think that you are writing your essay for the first question, and for that question you are writing for either how the setting influences how the novel is understood or how the novel is contextualized. In your draft you are writing about both. To contextualize the novel is to place the story in a certain context, and to understand the novel is to see the intended meaning of the setting.  The novel that you are focusing on needs to be clarified in order for you to provide evidence and be able to discuss your thoughts. You need structure and paragraphs too.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Good, insightful, comments Natasha. I'm glad someone mentioned the affect / effect -- it's one of the tougher word rules to master, but essential in this case. 

Only one issue. While I sense that you are driving at the switching of tenses in the draft, always best to write in the present tense. This avoids the passive voice ("has been said" vs. "says"). As a rule, the story events in a text are always described in the present tense in essays: "Ethan works at..." not "Ethan worked at..." and "the character notes that..." not "the character noted that..." The only time you use the past tense is when you are referring to real-world timeframes, like the book itself: "The book WAS WRITTEN in ..." Or, in the case of historical moments: "Having lived within the context of discrimination, the author..."

So, if you're describing textual events or writing your essay: present tense. If you're situating the text in a context outside the story events or your essay: past tense. And, always the <a href="https://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=active%20voice" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">active voice</a>!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Aaron, from my understanding you chose the first essay question- what may be helpful is to narrow your focus on setting further by first picking one of the novels to use as an example and then choosing a particular setting within the novel. By writing about one specific setting you can then choose what it has to do with the rest of the story and why its important. I know this is a rough draft but I have a hard time figuring out what the point is you're trying to make here/ what the thesis is. Also a lot of the language feels repetitive. In the beginning you have many sentences about setting that are worded differently but mean the same thing. For instance : "When it comes to understanding the plot of a story, the setting often plays an important role. A stories setting is more than just a backdrop of the plot. It often plays an important role in developing the stories events and themes." When you write your essay I would recommend looking for repetition in your sentences and cutting out filler words that you don't need.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[It's very descriptive Aaron, which is good. Some of the things I would suggest is to tell the reader which novel you are writing about. 

Another thing is that it is  a little repetitive, as you said, " When it comes to understanding the plot of a story, the setting often plays an important role." and " It often plays an important role in developing the stories events and themes." You could probably leave out the "It often plays an important role..." in the second sentence. 

Besides that though, it's very well-thought out, plays on good key points, just try to elaborate on your points with specific examples, and the formal writing gives it a well-educated tone. Nice work!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Aaron, you didn’t do a horrible job but there are definitely a few things you could fix to make your essay awesome! First, this needed a title; I wasn’t sure who or what your essay was about, which book you were focusing your essay on. 

You don’t need to explain what the setting/plot etc. are about, as you need to assume and know the readers already understand what those terms are and how they work with one another, so there is no need to try and teach us knowledge we already know. Also, this seems like you explained parts of the actual essay question with isn’t necessary. 

I think you are basing your essay off the first option we were given…

“Discuss how setting influences how we understand OR contextualize one of the novels we have read so far.”

Focus on discussing either how the setting influences how we UNDERSTAND or CONTEXTUALIZE one of the novels you’ll have a great essay. You also need to address what novel you are going to reference. Don’t just base your essay telling us how plot, setting, narrative, character is all connected and how they make a good novel. WE KNOW!  

I would’ve liked to see you at least focus on one book so we could give you more of a direction about addressing a novel. I think once you figure out whether or not your going to focus on how the setting influences our understanding or helps contextualize one of the novels you will have a great essay. Try not to sound too repetitive when discussing your ideas. Some of your sentences really don’t need to be there, i.e., “Being engaged in the narrative will keep the reader flipping through the pages for hours on end”. 
Its just not relevant whatsoever, so just be careful you don’t ramble on about nonsense. 

Remember how to paragraph your thoughts, ideas; it just looks professional and organized. It will come when you have your topic picked and decide what book you are going to talk about. 

I hope this helped, good luck with the rest of your essay!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Aaron

There are definitely a few areas you could focus on in order to improve your essay. 
First of all, you have no title. As mentioned above, without a title the reader has absolutely no idea what to expect, what book you're writing on etc. 
Likewise, I think it would be beneficial to mention the novel you are referring to in the beginning of your essay as part of your introduction just to inform the reader.
Also, I think you are describing more of the general concepts and terms rather than relating them to the novel of your choice - after all, connections need to be made back to the story. 
Overall, it seems as if you know what idea/concept you're writing about and all you need to do is bring that back to the story. 
Good job for being the first one up!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I agree with the other commenters that this really feels like a long-winded definition rather than an essay talking about one of the books we've read. Rather than defining these terms, you should really focus on showcasing an example and explaining why it is relevant to the overall effect of the book. 
The logical flow of ideas isn't really apparent to me in your writing, some of the sentences feel like they should be organized the opposite way you wrote them. (for example, the first 2 sentences - "The setting has a tremendous affect on what happens in the story. When the story is contextualized, the reader gains a perspective and sense of where the plot might be headed." - First you say that setting has a tremendous *effect* on what happens, then you go on to context. Setting and context are certainly related but they're not the same, and it was really jarring to have you switch gears like that so quickly and I got confused about what you are really trying to write about)
After reading the entire thing, I know you understand how things work, but they do need to be tied into an specific example.

I, personally, don't mind there being no title, as long as it is apparent what you will be discussing within the first sentence or two, but I suppose now I know that I should include a title in my essay too.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Aaron,

After reading your first paragraph, I came to realize that most of your content was about the setting. I felt like it was more of a definition of what setting is rather than what the setting is in the book. I also feel like it would have been better if you included a title because it gives the reader an idea of what they're reading and also it gives the paragraph more credibility because it owns a title. 

I like how you go into detail with your explanations; however, you tend to repeat yourself more than necessary. For example, there was a sentence that was worded into three different ways and you repeated them one after the other. "Gets the reader engaged more and more. Hooked onto it. Engagement.."  and so forth was all used within the 3 sentences. I think you can be more concise with your sentences and there is no need to repeat it over and over in different ways! :)]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It came as a surprise when Ethan committed suicide because the reality of his mental situation was masked by the assumptions that were made about his character. Ethan is read as a stock nerd character and along with that title comes assumptions of an intellect with a bright future. The novel first introduces Ethan as “a senior engineer for client-side computing”(6) so right away he is labeled as important and intellectual. As the novel progresses, this character trait is brought along, reassuring the reader that Ethan can handle the stress in his life.

Without the proper qualifications, Ethan gets a complicated computer programming job, showing he is very capable. Harry gave Ethan the job in full faith that he could handle and succeed at it. Despite the questioning of other coworkers that had masters and PhDs in computer programming, Ethan started getting assigned the most technical of assignments.

Ethan was seen as just another programmer as he should be. Impatient, defensive, and condescending, are all traits of programmers that are expected so there was no reason to the stress of the workplace to cause Ethan’s suicide. Harry still didn’t think Ethan was crazy when he was in the ceiling panel above his desk trying to rip out the lights. Harry “admitted that he might have noticed how Ethan Levin was coming unglued right in front off everyone’s eyes, how the bug as it kept on in its Jester personality, was unnerving Ethan to the point of disintegration”(199). Ethan was even convincing himself that he was fine, further hiding his true thoughts. He was convinced that his life would be fine again when he found the bug. Ethan had so much drive to find the bug that he was expected not to quit, to keep working until he found it. He had this idea that everything would be alright if he found the bug. He could repair his life and move on just as soon as the bug was dealt with.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The transition between the first paragraph and the second paragraph needs to be a bit smoother. I think the addition of a few words or another transitioning sentence at the end of the first paragraph would make it work better. The last line of the first paragraph is good but might be better served later in your essay. 

In the quote from page 199 it should be “of” instead of off. There is a lot of summarizing and repetitiveness of how Ethan’s life will go back to normal, maybe consider analyzing why the  audience thought this because of his character and character traits.

This draft makes sense and answers the question of how the assumptions of a character affect how we read the character and their actions. This is a good start to an essay.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This is a great start to your essay! I was impressed by the depth of your thesis and the analyzation of Ethan as a character. I noticed that a few of your sentences are run on sentences. Instead of using a comma, in some cases it is better to use a period. You could also use a semicolon to make the sentence flow. 

The first sentence of the last paragraph of your draft seems a little awkward, maybe you would consider rephrasing it. I also think the second paragraph could be expanded on... consider writing about the opinion of Ethan's co-workers. 

Overall your essay is on track and you are certainly answering the question.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Good job on using an example to illustrate your point, and on the draft. It seems like you are answering the third question 

     I'm wondering/unsure if you are perhaps implying that maybe the bug is some sort of personification of Ethan's increasing instability, when relating that to how he lied to himself that this bug was nothing/lying about his mental health.

      I also noticed how you pointed out Ethan's robotic/methodical way of thinking, such as "fixed problem, now I can move on", and related that to the "stock nerd" character, very insightful.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Overall I like that your rough draft addresses Ethan’s lack of qualifications and how its related to the destruction of his mental health. Its true that he wasn’t qualified but evidently not knowing the basics or how to read the core dump made him crazy and was the reason he over looked the simplicity of the mistakes that caused the bug in the first place. The draft makes sense however I would recommend maybe starting the essay with an argument or question to make the rest of the paragraphs flow more coherently. I think it was a good idea to incorporate the stock character idea and your examples will support your essay well.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Great start! I liked how you got right to the point about Ethan's suicide and elaborated on it in detail later on in your paragraphs. 

However, your third paragraph seems rushed, as " how the bug as it kept on in its Jester personality," was a little confusing to read. Maybe transition over to talking what Harry thought a little smoother. Also, watch your spelling, for example, "right in front off everyone’s eyes." Instead of "off," it would be "of." But, overall, it is well-written and well-thought out with very good examples to go along with it. Good job.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I like the idea how you choose to analyze a character from the Bug and how Ethan is different from our stereotyped version of programmers. As breannesmith said, the first sentence of the last paragraph is quite confusing. You went from “Impatient, defensive, and condescending, are all traits of programmers that are expected so there was no reason to the stress of the workplace to cause Ethan’s suicide.” And then transition to “harry still didn’t think Ethan was crazy”. I feel like there’s no transition so I don’t quite understand what you are trying to say there. But overall, good start and good ideas in your essay.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Assumptions are made daily, almost instinctively by each one of us. Assumptions often leading to quick judgements about character, about personality and commonly jumping to conclusions. There is this constant notion that male characters must be strong, willing to fight to the finish, to rise above all and be the hero they are set out to be. After all, they must save their damsel in distress.

Being the dominant male character in The Bug, Ethan Levin shows us that being the noble hero for the male is not always the case; it is just the opposite. Successfully working as a programmer for a start up computer company Ethan is already presumed to be the generic, stock, computer geek. Ethan is made out to be important and clever by always being able to one-up his coworkers as he was the only one ever on schedule. Being that Ethan dealt with fixing bugs on a daily basis The Jester’s first few appearances didn’t phase him. It was not until The Jester became an office joke, recurring spontaneously unable to find a core that this stock assumption of rising above and fighting to the end undergoes a long downward spiral.

As the story continues, Ethan reveals himself to be the damsel in distress in need of saving, saving from the state of turmoil The Jester has released. Even with all of the misfortune Ethan was facing in his personal life, he is expected to find the dreadful bug that had been eating away at him. Finding the bug would allow him to begin piecing his life back together. Unfortunately, The Jester wasn’t going down that easy and with Ethan being set up as someone who could handle the stress was ultimately the cause of his unexpected demise.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I enjoyed reading the first three paragraphs of your essay. I can tell it was well thought out since each paragraph transitions well into the next. A few things to fix would be punctuation since there are some missing commas. Also, I'm not sure if you want to tie your thesis more into The Bug and Ethan... something to think about. 

In my opinion the last sentence of the second paragraph could be rephrased. It seems as if you are talking about the past in the first part of the sentence and then the present in the last part of the sentence. 

Many of your ideas can be expanded on. I think it would help the reader understand your essay if you expand on your ideas using seperate paragraphs. For example: one paragraph for his failed love life, one paragraph about his career and how he was sent off to workshops that he never really wanted to attend and maybe one paragraph about his habits and his home life - drinking, his neighbours and Martha?]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I really like that you challenged the expectations of the reader when you chose the title “Damsel in Distress” yet chose the damsel to be Ethan Levin. I think that’s a really creative way to challenge people to think differently about male characters. The draft makes sense and you described Ethans character clearly enough for the reader to understand why it was such a shock (for most of us) when he ultimately committed suicide.  The subject is narrow enough because your focus is on male character assumptions and Ethan is a great example of this. I find your introduction to be intriguing and also easy to follow which makes it a great start to an essay. The only thing I would change is to maybe add some support directly from the novel but other than that you are off to a good start.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[What is your thesis statement?  You have just made statements about assumptions. These are fine but you should clarify what your essay will ultimately argue or talk about and which character.

The second sentence in the first paragraph is either incomplete or needs to be lead instead of leading. Start-up is hyphenated. Phase should be faze. Try to stay away from clichés, like in the last line of your first paragraph; rephrasing that will make it stronger. Stay away from using “us” like in the first sentence of the second paragraph.

How does Ethan’s character come across as being “set up as someone who [can] handle the stress”? What evidence is there to prove that he is a strong character? What makes the reader think this? Being a computer geek and working successfully does not show strong character but intelligence and perhaps dedication. If you were to expand on these questions, I think your essay would be stronger once finished. 

Good start and it is a fairly focused and narrow topic.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[With reading through some of the other comments made, I have to agree that this beginning portion lacks a bit of focus to get the rest of the paper started.

I think you are stating too many assumptions, rather than facts about what has happened and what they actually mean about Ethan being the “damsel in distress” and the bug. 

In the opening of the second paragraph, it sounds to be a bit repetitive with calling Ethan the “dominant male character” where you could simply refer to him as the “protagonist” and then explain your ideas.
Overall, it’s definitely a good start to the essay, try to find more direct references from the novel to support your thesis.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I really enjoyed reading this part of your essay. Right away I was interested and wanted to read more. I liked how you made the reference about a "damsel in distress" but the damsel was Ethan. Right away I'm thinking "oh it has to be a female" character. It made me think of viewing the characters differently (gives us a different pov which I like and I'm sure everyone will too). 

You didn't talk to the audience as if we haven't read the book which was nice because I knew exactly what you meant describing characters and events in the book. I'm not sure what part of your essay this is in but just be careful your clear on your thesis and what your essays about. 

So far you've been really specific and to the point. Although, I would try to expand on some of your ideas and seperate the different ideas so we aren't confused and your essay flows better. 

Great job so far, good luck with the rest of your essay!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Great shift here! I like it a lot. As you move through the editing phase, think about defining the characteristics of the damsel in distress. Readers need to know where you're coming from with that... don't assume they know. And, this will also give you a set of criteria within which to explore Ethan's character -- how is he a damsel in distress when...

You needn't go hunting in Wikipedia or whatever for definitions of damsel in distress btw. Just think about what you mean by the phrase and then give us an introduction that foregrounds the characteristics you see as important in the phrase for the essay that will follow. What's important is that you are laying out the THINGS / STUFF you will deal with in the text that suggest Ethan is in fact activating the literary <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=trope&oq=trope&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.845j0j7&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=119&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">trope</a> (there's a big word for ya) of the damsel in distress.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I definitely think you have an intriguing and relevant topic here. I think you can go a few different directions though. You have a broad topic that can be narrowed a little bit. I also wonder, was finding the bug really going to fix his life, or was the downward spiral already past the point of no return (having his gf cheat on him and then leave him etc.. ). Maybe Ethans demise had more to do with inability to cope with stress, turning to drinking and isolating himself socially, rather than the stressor itself. Again, I think its a very interesting topic as I for one was surprised at the way it turned out. I think there is a lot of truth about what you say about our assumptions of gender roles in this story, or any story.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I love the genderbent title-essay!! Had piqued my interest! I may suggest changing some grammar such as "in need of saving; saving from the bug" instead of a comma? I like the transitions, smooth yet not forced as if you're trying to piece together a half-hazard essay. Another thing may be to expand upon Ethans life outside of The Jester and work? Still overall I love the concept of using Damsels in Distress for this. Kudo's!! (Koodose? I'm not exactly sure how you spell it."]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>“Wise, old, smiley,” these are some of the words that Clay Jannon, the narrator and dynamic character in “Mr. Penumbra’s 24 Hour Bookstore,” are some of the words he would use to describe his mentor, Ajax Penumbra, or simply, Mr. Penumbra, in the novel. In Mr. Penumbra’s 24 Hour Bookstore, Clay and Mr. Penumbra are not only colleagues in the story, but also friends, partner, and they definitely have a teacher-student relationship, as well. This is evident in how they are portrayed in the book, some examples include:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Clay going out to New York to rescue Mr. Penumbra because he simply cares for his well-bring. Another would be Clay assisting Mr. Penumbra in obtaining the Codex Vitae: a book from the late Aldus Manutius that guarantees immortality to anybody that cracks the code within. Lastly, would be Mr. Penumbra mentoring Clay in running his 24-hour bookstore, and teaching Clay the ways of the Unbroken Spine in New York City. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> This shows that Penumbra and Clay’s relationship is based on more than just business, it is based on loyalty and friendship. Penumbra trusts Clay personally to run his bookstore, and to share personal, deep secrets of the Unbroken Spine with him, even entrusting Clay with recovering the MANVTIVS codex vitae from the depths of the Unbroken Spine. It would seem that Penumbra looks at Clay as a type of “family” to him, a position that seems rather rare in Penumbra’s world as we go venture throughout the story. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Clay’s relationship with Penumbra is not surprising though, because Clay does seem very friendly and open to others, thus drawing in other people, such as North Face (Daphne) from Booty’s, Kat Potente from Google, and Edgar Deckle from the Unbroken Spine. He does a very good job in bringing people to him, as well as seeking them out, too. All these elements certainly assist Clay in developing relationships with the characters in the story, as well as driving the story forward in a way that is entertaining seeing as Clay is the main character/narrator in the story, too. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Mr. Penumbra is no slouch either in the “making friends” department. He is friendly, always cheerful, and soft-spoken. All attributes that are useful in drawing others in to certain individuals. </span></p>
<p class="p1"></p>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Your essay is off to a good start. In the first paragraph, the first sentence is a little repetitive. It might also help to read it aloud to catch some of the grammatical errors. I don't think it is necessary to say "some examples include" instead a smooth transition into the next paragraph would be sufficient. To help the reader understand your essay it might be better to break each one of your examples into separate paragraphs. Currently it seems a little choppy. 

When transitioning into your third paragraph it is not exactly clear what you are talking about when you say "this shows". Also the last sentence in this paragraph is a little awkward. Maybe consider rephrasing this by using more formal words. 

Make sure you tie each paragraph in with your thesis. This will help your audience understand the message of your essay and the different components in your essay that relate to your thesis.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The main idea of your draft is well thought out but what you may want to consider is how you structure your paragraphs. For instance the first paragraph ends with a colon and leads to the next with examples to support your thesis. Although your examples are good you should incorporate them into your writing a little smoother instead of just listing them. I also noticed you have a lot of run on sentences and some words that don't really make sense for example "slouch" wouldn't be a way to describe someone. Like Breanne said above, you may want to read this out loud but I think you have a good start here.]]></wp:comment_content>

On the other hand, your essay does not flow and as a reader I had to keep stopping abruptly because of the grammatical errors. When listing the evidence, be sure to piece the sentences in a way that isn't so confusing. I suggest that some of your sentences can be reworded and be put in different parts of the sentence and new vocabulary can also be introduced to clear up confusion.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[You approached this topic in an interesting way and made some really good points. Try to avoid repeating “are some of the words” twice in the same sentence. Your ideas do tie together with your ideas behind Clay and Penumbra’ relationship, although you may want to reconsider rearranging your paragraphs and revising for spelling errors. Some of your sentences appear to be too short and some other appear to be too long, maybe use some transitional words, I think that would really help. Other than that, I think you have many  good examples to back up all of your ideas.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey Jonathan, your first sentence is a run-on with a repetition of “are some of the words”. The essay can also use some good essay structure. You can connect some of your paragraphs together and make them sound good. However, you use good detail and you give a good description of the two characters relationship. Aside from a few minor errors, you are off to a good start.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I have to agree with Breanne and DENISEHUA- your paragraphs are choppy or lack 'flow'. You have some interesting points and evidence to prove Penumbra and Clay’s relationship is more than just colleagues, but all of it seems to be jumbled up throughout the paragraphs. And although you have direction, you don’t ever explain WHY your points are important. You have a good start in the third paragraph by stating something about their relationship, and giving evidence too, but its lacking an explanation! For instance you could benefit greatly by explaining why it is important that Clay was entrusted to recover Manutius’ codex. What makes Clay so important to Penumbra and vice versa? Penumbra could have easily told Oliver Grone the secrets and have him recover Manutius’ codex…]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Good start, but like others, you need to narrow your focus. Sentences such as "Clay and Mr. Penumbra are not only colleagues in the story, but also friends, partner, and they definitely have a teacher-student relationship, as well" are too wordy and try to encapsulate too much information. Pick one thing and go from there. How is their relationship that of teacher-student? What might that tell us about the characteristics of learning, for instance? 

How do Penumbra and Clay offer up a different paradigm for the teacher  / student relationship? How do you mean "teacher" and "student"? How would YOU define those terms in this context? 

See, there's plenty just in that dichotomy for a short essay. Do you really need to cover "colleagues" and so on? And then, what do you mean by these other terms? They'll all need to be defined as well. A lot to cover in three pages. NARROW THE FOCUS.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The character relationship between Clay and Penumbra is a very interesting one in how they quickly bond so well and has lots of areas to write on for an essay. I had to read the first sentence a couple times to get it though. "are some of the words" is said twice and doesn't make the sentence flow. But, I see the idea behind it and it is a great first sentence to get the essay going. I like the comparison of how they are both friendly and can draw individuals and is why they bonded and worked together so well. Maybe focus on a certain part of the relationship cause it does seem a little broadly focused.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[woops accidentally hit post. 

Anyways, It has too many commas and probably has 2 or 3 sentences worth of content. As stated previously, reading your sentences will help you catch grammar errors and typos.

 Also, you speak of the character relationship but you spend a large majority of the essay proving that Clay and Mr.Penumbra were indeed friends. You point to specific scenarios, which is good, but what does their friendship mean? Why have you decided to zero-in on this friendship specifically? Assume that we know about their friendship, and instead, you should focus on what their friendship says about _______ . Don't waste chunks of your essay pointing out details, try to tie them together.  

As it stands, you conclude your draft by stating that the attributes of being friendly and cheerful are attributes that we seek in friends - it is not a very thought provoking thesis. You are on the right track and have demonstrated your ability to find facts and organize them, but what needs work is the lack of content discussing the connections and meaning/impact behind these facts in the story. 

Good work on your essay, hopefully this helps.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify">Clark Moffat in Robin Sloan’s,<em> Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore</em>, just like Ajax Penumbra, creates the very meaning of a wise old man. Wise old man, its definition as striking as Clark Moffat’s character, is an elderly stock character who provides our protagonist with wisdom; answers to the protagonist’s many questions.  Clark Moffat fulfills this stock character as he subtly, almost secretively, guides our protagonist, Clay Jannon, the key to everlasting life through his novels: Dragon-Song Chronicles. Clark Moffat plays an important character in the novel as the wise-old-<em>dead</em>-man who arms Clay with wizards and dragons in his obsession with finding the key. As a wise old man, Clark Moffat instills in Clay and us, readers, that everlasting life is the lasting relationships we make with the people we meet through the choice he made between publishing his <em>codex vitae</em> or Clay’s beloved novels.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Although Ajax Penumbra could be the wise old man, Clark Moffat separates himself with the sole reason that he has died and is still able to push through his knowledge to Clay. Assumptions with the stock character make us think that Moffat will be guiding Clay as he solves for the answer. And he accomplished this despite his death;  Moffat lead Clay away from using technology and set him in the right path through his stories about his dragons.  Truly, he had the wisdom and made the right choice to publish his novels. Initially, Moffat as the wise old man character is not evident because of how Clay brings him to the story, though as we move on, Moffat has driven us to the answer ever since Clay mentioned how he loved Moffat’s works in the beginning of the novel. As can be seen, The Dragon-Song Chronicles tell the story behind the intriguing answer to everlasting life in a very discreet way. It is definitely exciting to discover that the chronicles tell the actual story behind how everything started. Consequently, the novel by Moffat describes “Griffo [making] an instrument so perfect that even the dead must rise to hear its call” (199), the very reason why they say that it is the answer to living forever. Moreover, Moffat clearly confirms our assumptions that he is indeed wise, thus leads our protagonist to the fulfillment of his quest.</p>]]></content:encoded>

I would recommend to not be very repetitive in your paragraphs, you repeated Clark Moffat multiple times, maybe it would be simpler if you just used the last name instead of writing his full name. I would also recommend to just keep your paragraphs in third person. There were times when you referenced to yourself or other readers by using “us” which is a first person point of view.]]></wp:comment_content>

Overall, you've done a really good job so far! Good luck with the rest of your essay.]]></wp:comment_content>

The only thing that I could probably suggest is you don't always have to mention "Clay" and "Clark Moffat" by name so many times. 

Anyways, I liked how you used Clark Moffat as a comparison with Clay, instead of the usual "Mr. Penumbra and Clay" comparison, which I did. Keep up the good work!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Paula
The excerpt from your essay sounds interesting as many others have mentioned. I think it's extremely creative how you used Clark Moffat as the center of your essay because his character was important to Clay although it was not mentioned as often. I think you made good connections between Moffat's novels and his codex vitae which makes a strong point. I am wondering what other points you have in mind to mention in your essay.
Great job]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Great start and great title. Well done. You might work toward cleaning up some wordiness. Take the last sentence of the first paragraph: do we need "us" in there at all? Why are you mentioning the audience? Is the audience important or do you just need to concentrate on the Moffat / Clay relationship characteristics. What does it matter that the audience identify with that? 

Also, second paragraph: do you need Ajax in there? Why draw our attention to him? I get that you are trying to set Moffat apart from Penumbra, but this sets up a false dichotomy. In other words, everything works fine without mentioning Penumbra (just take that sentence out) and the argument / description you offer here is much more focused if he's not in the frame of reference. 

So, clean things up a but and let the essay tell you where it wants to go... very holistic, but trust me; it'll tell you what it wants to talk about.]]></wp:comment_content>

I like the idea of Clark Moffat’s importance in the story and your insight of why it is. Great start to your essay but like other classmates, I have noticed that there are a lot of repetitive words that are probably not necessary. Overall I have enjoyed reading your essay so far, great job!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Perhaps you should use a word like "embodies" or something along that line instead of "creates" when you say that Clark Moffat and Ajax Penumbra ressemble the stock character of the wise old man. I am also not sure about your assertion that there can only be one wise old man character in the book. But perhaps it would be best to not mention Penumbra outside of the introductory section of your essay. 

The last few sentences get a bit confusing... "consequently"? and "moreover"? maybe they should be switched, because the last sentence is more of a conclusion and the one preceding it just has a piece of evidence.

Definitely a good start :)]]></wp:comment_content>

Your rough draft is well structured and easily  understood. I liked how you connected Clark Moffat to Clay; beside your title is attractive. In the second paragraph you mainly wrote about Moffat and Clay, so   I’m not sure why you wrote about Ajax in the beginning and then he disappeared from the content. As it mentioned previously, by using “Us”   yon are reflecting a personal assumption. Other than that, well done and good luck with the rest of your essay.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA["Dragons are Man's Best Friend”. You have an engaging title as it is the first thing I noticed before reading your essay. It’s compelling in other words. I also like your description about Clark Moffat and that even though he is not the main character of the book, he actually plays a large role in aiding Clay to solve the code. So good analyzing there and the first paragraph has flow. That makes it easy to follow. For the second paragraph, I have no criticisms as you analyze Moffat very thoroughly and how important he is to Clay. So good luck on your easy writing!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I really like this essay draft- I think that the topic is interesting and explains the captivating title. You didn't use the easy way out and use basic characters- instead you seem to have found different and unique connections. It's also well structured, however I noticed some choppiness in your sentences. It doesn't flow as well as it could. The first sentence is explanative, though I feel that it can easily lose the interest of the audience with it's length. Great writing!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Looking from the outside in for Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore, the store looks as though it is a normal looking store in the middle of San Francisco. Nothing about the store front stands out other than the fact that it is a bookstore right next to a bar. Once you step inside your opinion changes in the way that you don't think of the store as what we would think to be a normal bookstore, such as Chapters. The store is designed so that at the front, you have common books that anyone would buy, but in the "way back" section you will find books that belong to the Unbound Script. The store plays a big role in the setting and leading us to where the book goes next. It all starts in this tiny bookstore, shelves lining all the walls and aisles from the ground to the ceiling that has a sort of mysterious feel behind it. This starts off the novel of how Clay Jannon will discover the Unbound Script. Just like the Unbound Scripts main headquarters, there is a building there that hides their true identity. The Fortes Lente Company is all above ground in the building in New York, while beneath it there is the whole underground area where people of the hidden society can find Manutius, the Codex Vitae. The bookstores true identity is hidden at the front so that when you first walk into the store you will find all these books that would seem like normal books to find in a bookstore, but if you know where to look, you will find the important codex vitae of many of the members of the Unbound Script in the shelves at the back hidden by darkness. The way the bookstore was set up and how the narrator, Clay Jannon, describes the place you get the sense that something more is happening in this bookstore than what meets the eye. This sets up the entire book and in what direction the story is headed. The way the bookstore is also described sets up very well the theme of old knowledge vs new knowledge. With the bookstore looking old, musky and dark you can really visualize that it is old knowledge that you find within this bookstore.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'd be careful when starting sentences with the word "This", you start multiple sentences with “This”, and it comes across as unclear at times. Another tendency I noticed was that throughout the essay you were speaking in second person, not that it’s technically wrong, it might just cost you marks if you don’t utilize it properly. It’s better to stick to third person past tense in my opinion for the type of essay you are attempting. 

The analysis between the book store and the Fortes Lente Company is accurate as they both operate under the ruse of an ordinary, boring, location.  Relating Mr.Penumbras 24hr bookstore to our expectations of a typical book store is, and a typical book as-well is also a very insightful comparison. Perhaps you could go into detail about what is “expected” from a typical book, and you can describe how Mr.Penumbra’s bookstore, and the books inside the book store, violate these expecations. 

However how does old knowledge exactly relate to the narrative that Clay Jannon use to describe the bookstore? Clay Jannon was definitely intrigued by the appearance of the book-store, and in particular about its odd dimensions. Can you think of any tell-tale signs of the Fortes Lente Company that were out of the ordinary as well, hinting that there may be something unusual going on? And did the narrative serve to point this out? 

You also mentioned narrative, conflict of old vs new, as well as setting of the book store at the end of your essay. You will find it easier to narrow in on just one of these aspects, and draw examples from the novel. Your comparisons are well placed overall when discussing expectations vs reality with the two settings, in my opinion that was the strongest part of your draft]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Ey. It pains me when I, the reader, is addressed in your essay, so please restrict your self from using "you" or "your" as I want to be apart of your essay. I don't. You're also summarizing a great deal. It's alright to summarize a minor detail, but everything about the bookstore is too much. We already know that. You mentioned the bookstore represents OK and never bothered to expand on new knowledge, because I don't know the very definition of new knowledge? You repeated how the bookstore is important at least three times. If this is your intro paragraph, I'd suggest narrowing it a great deal by: not summarizing a great deal, repeating points, and sticking to a nice and narrow point that your paragraph revolves around.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for the rough draft, it's evident that you've put some thoughts into it, so that's awesome. But your draft sounds more like a summary than trying to analyze how the setting has influenced your understanding of the story. (assuming that this is your topic). Therefore, this draft somewhat fails to address the topic question. I suggest that you narrow it down more and try to avoid the obvious details. We all know that the bookstore is in San Francisco, but perhaps you might address why it would be in San Francisco and not elsewhere? Would the story be the same if the bookstore was in Surrey? 

I hope this helps, editing or evaluating drafts isn't my thing.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[In the approximately 350 word excerpt you gave, you used the word bookstore/store 18 times (I was curious so I checked). I think writing about the bookstore itself is a great idea, and one that might be overlooked by a majority of the other students, however I had trouble pinpointing what your thesis was and what this special “bookstore” had to do anything with.
 
I think you need to avoid summarizing too much facts that the reader already knows about the book, providing some description of the bookstore is good, but not when you’re explaining a bulk of the plot with it. 

As for some of the outcomes this week, I think this module is going to help the editing process of my essay because it has led me to look at the finer details, such as assumption making and plot summarizing that may take away from the overall impact my essay has. I think when I am to edit my essay, I’ll look at it objectively and ask myself what others might think about the points I am highlighting and what they mean.

All your information is clear and concise and relates well to the points you are trying to make. My only suggestions would be to reformat this so that it is not just one large paragraph, that way it is easier to read and it separates your ideas allowing the reader to better process each one,  and also use more transitional words to connect the sentences that are generally shorter. Regardless, you are off to a really good start.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey Rachel, great start but you do have a few errors. One of noticeable things is the use of words such as “you”. You also start many sentences with “the” or “this”. It is better to start off sentences NOT using these words. You can use better words to start off sentences. One of the tools I personally use is a thesaurus. It will definitely help you in this aspect. Another noticeable thing is the essay structure. The clear way to start off is by your thesis and by talking about the main points you will be talking about. Before I submitted my first paragraph I thought it was just a regular 350 word assignment like yours. The good thing is we still have time to make our improvements. Great try and good luck with your complete essay!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I felt like your essay was mostly about summarizing the book although it did had some good insight but it wasn't specific enough because of the use of "This" or "That". I suggest rewording you sentences so the reader will know for sure what you are trying to target. I am not entirely sure if using second person and addressing the reader as "you" is very necessary for a formal draft, try sticking to third so the readers are not awkwardly pulled in the essay.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[All the comments are steering you in the right direction. I would add that you be careful about your format and logic. This needs some paragraphing and FESTINA LENTE, not what you have -- make sure you are spelling and naming textual examples correctly, otherwise you look real lazy.

There's also a lot of pointing here. You need more showing and less telling. What does all that you have described mean? What purpose does it serve to the story? How does it drive the narrative in a particular direction? Try to get at these questions and you'll have something. Push toward the deeper meaning... give your pointing some significance!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[From your essay the reader can understand what your main topic is for your essay. As suggested in the previous comments, I would also recommend avoiding using words such “you” and use alternative words such as the “reader” or the “individual” because it would make your writing better for a formal essay. I think that you may have a lot of different of ideas about how the bookstore is the setting that puts the book together. But I would recommend focusing your idea on one specific reason about the bookstore that makes it an important setting and focus on the different aspects of that, rather than naming all the reasons why the bookstore is important. All in all, your essay has plenty of different of topics you can chose to narrow from and you seem to understand the bookstore setting well enough to produce a great essay.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[When you say "you" so often in an essay, it really feels like you're telling me what to think, rather than just explaining the details so that I can be convinced by what you want to discuss and whether you have any valid points to offer. I'm also not sure that you need to mention the *Festina* Lente Company if you are writing about Penumbra's store in this essay. It could be that in this draft you didn't have enough time to expand on your thoughts on how the Festina Lente Company relates to the setting of Penumbra's 24-Hr Bookstore, but unless it is used in order to highlight the differences in specific, instead of general ways, perhaps it should be left out. 
Finding the evidence in the book will definitely help fill out your arguments, but you have a good base for your essay.

Also, some of the flow of logic and wording could be improved. I find what always helps me is reading it aloud to myself and tweaking it from there.]]></wp:comment_content>

I enjoyed reading your draft and I understood that you are writing about the setting and how its affect the story. But I think what you wrote it’s  more a summary about the book store and how its look like and I couldn’t got  a lot about old knowledge vs new knowledge . Yes the bookstore looking old, musky and dark so there is old knowledge but what about the new knowledge. I think what you wrote is good but it’s general and it’s not leading to specific ideas. Overall you have good understanding for the story and there are a lot of good ideas in your draft.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think that the content in your draft is great, however your sentence structure and flow can use work. There were several times that I was lost and other times where I wasn't sure what your point was. I also don't recommend addressing the audience ("you will find", "you get the sense"). In addition, I'd advise you to look into some different transitional words so that you can start off your sentences with more grace. Try to be a little more careful with your wording so that it reads easily, also. 
Although I liked your opinions and explanation of the novel, I wasn't completely sure what the topic was. I found that it frequently switched from setting of the bookstore to the setting of the Festina Lente headquarters and back to the bookstore again. Maybe try to stick with one area or expand on both places in different sections of your essay?]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Rachel,

After reading your paragraph, I thought it was quite a bit for one paragraph. I as a reader would have preferred for it to be in multiple paragraphs because it is easier on the eyes and it would be easier to follow along and understand the content. It also allows the reader to organize the information that they are reading. 

I also came to the conclusion that it was more of a summary. As an introduction paragraph, I understand that you're supposed to give the reader a little information so that they could understand the background. However, the way you summarized may have been a little bit too much - especially for someone who has already read the book. You just need to include enough information so that the reader knows the basics and it refreshes their memory for someone who already read it.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I enjoy the describing of the bookstore in detail but I feel it is boarderline summarizing entirely about the store itself. What are you connecting it too? It's unclear. Use paragraphs to break up larger bodies of text like this it will be more effective. Also as mentioned before refrain from assuming we haven't read the book. We have, so tell us your thoughts about it without having to spell it out for someone like your grandma who hasn't read it. This will make the essay much neater and more concise.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Mr. Penumbra’s 24 hour bookstore was not a typical romantic storyline. Clay and Kat had a unique relationship that not many stories will include. Boy meets girl, they both fall in love and live happily ever after. Robin Sloan did not have this kind of love story in mind. Not every relationship in every book has to have a happy ending where the boy and girl end up together. In this case, Clay and Kat are a prime example of the couple that does not last forever.

Adventures and mysteries are irresistible. Clay’s life consisted of adventure and mystery. This made Clay intriguing for Kat. Clay was deeply involved in solving the code of the Unbroken Spine. The 500 year old mystery was to keep Kat’s attention until the code was solved. The two young adults spent all of their time together researching and discovering different possible answers to the code. However, just like all adventures, their relationship would come to an end.

Clay is a web designer that has been laid off due to the collapse of the economy. This sent Clay on a mission to find a job to help him get by until he could find another job that would suit his fancy. Clay ended up with the night shift at Mr. Penumbra’s bookstore. He quickly became aware of the unique traits of the bookstore. Clay is a curious character and began to question the real purpose of the library. He discovered the Unbroken Spine and began to solve the mystery. Clay became obsessed with solving the code and would not stop until he found the answer. Clay is comparable to a video gamer or a computer geek, although not to that extreme. He is curious enough to take the investigation into his own hands and learn to solve for himself. Though he is involved in the researching through books and the library, Clay also brings in the strategy of researching through google. Clay represents the balance of old knowledge and new knowledge through books and computer technology. His balance between the two was slightly influenced by Kat the google programmer.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I really enjoyed this excerpt right from the beginning as I felt drawn in from the opening few sentences. Although there is a lot to say for Clay and Kat, I felt as if you got down to the point right away in explanations given. 

Reading through, in the last paragraph you begin with “Clay is a web designer that has been laid off due to the collapse of the economy”, which to me sounded like you were explaining too much of the plot rather than assuming your audience has read the book already. Consider changing that to “Following the collapse of the economy that led to Clay being laid off…” or anything on those lines so it doesn’t sound like the reader has no idea of what you’re writing about. 

Overall, what I think is a really great start to the essay!

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The first paragraph is a good start in addressing the question about discussing the relationship of Clay and Kat. The third line of “Boy meets girl…", however, suggests that the sentence is explaining Clay and Kat’s unique relationship. Its confusing in a minor way as the sentence is not supposed to. I see how you might ‘clear up’ the confusion with the subsequent sentence, but its best to just keep everything coherent from the get go. For example, you could write “Robin Sloan did not have the typical love story in mind of boy meets girl, they fall in love and live happily ever after. Instead…(explain briefly how Clay and Kat don’t last forever)”.

The second and third paragraphs don’t really make sense with your initial direction. They kind of go on to really summarize the book, not even the relationship. I would suggest writing about WHY their relationship gives meaning to the book. Why did it fail? What do we have to learn from their relationship? 

I am also confused as to where the direction of the essay is going (in the 3rd para) when you suggest Clay’s balance of OK and NK is only slightly influenced by Kat. That in itself could be an entirely different essay. While each paragraph has a narrowed focus, they each go off in a different direction. Pick one idea and run with it! 

Good luck!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The comments above are good. Take those into account. You might also look at sentences such as "Clay and Kat had a unique relationship that not many stories will include..." You are making an incorrect assumption here. There are many stories that include a boy meeting a girl and some sexual tension ensuing; in fact, there's tons of those!

Point is, make sure you are not making unnecessary assumptions just to make things "sound" like an essay. Everything you mention should have a purpose to your subject. Sentences like the above suggest that you are trying to find a way of distinguishing the story from others when, according to your subject, you do not need to... the big question you beg here is: were Clay and Kat ever designed to be together? 

Push your ideas.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Jessica
I enjoyed reading the first few lines of your essay.
Like Malak said, the third paragraph focuses too much on the plot in my opinion. Instead of describing the story, it would be better to explain or give examples on why Clay and Kat's relationship didn't work out. Was it because Google failed to solve the code ? Was Kat not compatible with Clay in the first place? Did her new job at Google have anything to with their relationship falling apart? 
There are many reasons you could use to support your thesis, thus making your essay stronger. 
In addition, your last sentence regarding Kat's 'slight' influence over Clay's perspective of old knowledge and new knowledge was slightly confusing to me because I couldn't understand what you were trying to say. 
Perhaps that's another, separate topic area you could divulge in for your essay.
Great ideas though!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[After reading your first paragraph I believe the idea is that relationships in a story do not always have a happy ending. This is a interesting idea and essay topic. I believe you are on the right track by using Clay and Kat from Mr. Penumbra’s 24-hour book store as the focus on your essay. I also can see where you are trying to go with the second paragraph but I agree that third paragraph sounds more like a book summary. I think if you are trying to do an essay on the relationship between Clay and Kat, then you could give reasons on how and why the relationship is important to the story.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Your essay had an interesting start and the topic chosen for your essay was clearly understood from the first line. However in the third paragraph you start to discuss Clay’s relationship with a different subject. I think this might cause your essay to have too many ideas but bot info on just one specific one. So I would recommend focusing it on Clay and Kat’s relationship or Clay’s relationship with the old and new knowledge. There also isn’t any transition on the paragraphs so maybe add words or sentences that flows the paragraphs together. However, you do have two great topics that you can chose from between paragraph 1&amp;2 and paragraph three that would produce an interesting essay.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Good idea for an essay it really shows what drove the relationship between Clay and Kat and why it eventually ended. I like the few short sentences you have like "Adventures and mysteries are irresistible" it is a good starting sentence for the paragraph and gets the text flowing nicely. It seemed a few times you were getting away from the idea of their relationship and instead focusing solely on Clay's character but I'm assuming you are going to expand on Kat's character as well. No grammatical errors other than the one's already said in other comments so good start.]]></wp:comment_content>

I enjoy reading your draft. After reading the first paragraph, I though your essay will be about Clay and Kat relationship but the second and third paragraph did not led me to the same though. I enjoyed reading the third paragraph, as it is summery about Clay circumstances and his interest but nothing to do with Kat; beside, you wrote about old knowledge and new knowledge at the end of the paragraph ( books and computer technology) and linked with Kat  which could  be foundation for another interesting essay. 
Good luck.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Jessica, your ideas were nice. Your essay was grammatically correct and there were little to no errors, aside from that I feel like you should elaborate on your ideas more. The structure and the ideas are there but I suggest expanding on them so readers are not left guessing. Here are some questions that may help:
Why/ how was clay's new/ old knowledge influenced by Kat? 
Could there be a possible way that their relationship could've been saved? 
Hope this was useful!]]></wp:comment_content>

He doesn't have her level of ambition and intellect and so what unites them, only temporarily, is cracking the code. When they no longer have they, they quickly realize they are not meant to be.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>War Games Module - Character Details</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Instructions:</strong> <em>Due for Feb. 4th class.</em> This module is meant to get you thinking about the specifics of characterization so that you can better discuss what those specifics might mean to the themes in a text. The idea here is to see how establishing a baseline "read" of a character can give you a solid footing for building a more robust argument about themes in the text.

As we have done in the past, this exercise is a way of interpreting and understanding how a text is put together or "constructed." Understanding how something is put together allows us to interpret it better. We can compare it to other things put together in a similar way (to other novels, for instance), or about similar things (to other stories), or that have similar parts (hackers as characters). However, before we discuss other things, we need to have some specifics.

To put it bluntly, we need to establish what we have in front of us so we can discuss how it is similar or different to something else. We also want to position ourselves so that we can clearly distinguish what it is a character signals.

<strong>Summary:</strong>

<strong>Task:</strong> After watching <em>War Games</em>, make a few suggestions about the <strong>specific</strong> qualities of at least two characters from the movie --can be big role or small roll, but must be in the movie, somewhere.

<strong>Outcomes:</strong> Think about how these specific qualities suggest "stock" elements. Then, think about how those "stock" elements point our interpretation and expectations in a certain direction. 

<ul>
	<li>How do a character's personality traits cause suspense and suspicion? What are the specifics of those traits and how do they work to cause suspicion or suspense?</li>
	<li>How do character traits drive the narrative forward? (For instance, a particularly belligerent character might prevent an easy resolution ot the story; or, a particularly crafty criminal might create conflict where there wasn't conflict previously.)</li>
	<li>How do specific character traits come together to make the character appear stock? And, once you've figured this out, what's different about THIS character's characteristics that make him/her interesting or uninteresting? (Who do we focus on and why?)</li>
<li>Which specific character traits of David Lightman match those of Ethan Levin? Which traits are quite different? What's different about the narrative outcomes and why?</li>
</ul>

<strong>Takeaways:</strong>

<ul>
<li>You're always safer making assumptions if you compile textual examples around a central part of the text--how are settings alike, how are characters similar, but different. "No facts but in THINGS."</li>
<li>Take account of your own assumptions about character types--nerds, rockers, emos, hipsters, etc. Are those assumptions borne out through the text? Or are you simply relying on your assumptions? Does the text play with your assumptions to create suspense, make a point, or resolve conflicts?</li>
<li>Characters often determine how we read or "decode" a theme. Charafters often try to pressure our "decoding" by distorting personality traits, forcing us to engage with new ways of understanding the representations, themes, and conflicts at play in the text.<li>
<li>Any analysis always begins with specific examples. You need to have specifics in order make general assumptions. Once you have established that baseline, you can move on to make more general commentaries.</li>
</ul> 

<strong>Task, Reminder:</strong> Remember to respond to some of the questions above (in "Outcomes" or ") in the comment space below. Refer to <a href="http://digitalcultureslab.ca/hybrid1102/course-procedures/" title="Course Procedures">the course procedures page</a> -- the "Work Away from Class" section -- if you're confused about what you are supposed to be doing in the comment space below.
 
Some of the characters in <em>War Games</em>:

<ul>	<li>David Lightman</li>
	<li>Dr. John McKittrick</li>
	<li>Dr. Stephen Falken </li>
	<li>Joshua / WOPR (are these two characters maybe?)</li>
	<li>Lightman's science teacher</li>
	<li>Jennifer Mack</li>
	<li>General Jack Beringer</li>
	<li>Pat Healy</li>
	<li>Watson</li>
	<li>Col. Joe Conley</li>
	<li>Beringer's Assistant</li>
	<li>Capt. Jerry Lawson</li>
	<li>Lt. Steve Phelps</li>
	<li>Mr. and Mrs. Lightman</li>
	<li>Mr. Liggett</li>
	<li>Joshua Falken (the "real" one in the video)</li>
<li>Any of the missile launch dudes</li>
<li>The voice of the woman on the loudspeaker in NORAD before WOPR / Joshua magically takes over</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Dr.Stephen Falking is difficult to fit into one category. As at one point he appeared to be unphased by the prospect of the world going into nuclear holocaust and civilization being exterminated.

 He directly opposed the protagonist (David Lightman) at the point of confrontation between the two characters. Being a combination of an absent minded professor (Not knowing how to disarm WOPR, and being unalarmed by it, as if he knew it was faulty in it's inability to learn futility) as well as directly opposing David Lightman he becomes a sort of Black-Knight. (Think Darth Vader in star wars, who has a change of heart near the end of the film and makes up with Luke Skywalker as hes dying)

Stephen Falken also has a change of heart, when he swoops in with his helicopter, and uses his authority and recognition in the U.S. Nuclear Command center to give David Lightman acess to Joshua/WOPR. However, in all honesty, Stephen Falken was not a very interesting character. It wasn't very clear why he had such an odd, "oh well who cares" out look on life. And the change of heart he had didn't make any sense to me. It seemed tacky and lame that he swooped in on a helicopter to save the day.

David Lightman is a hero, of course, but a reluctant one at that. In the beggining of the movie, David Lightman just wanted to play video games. He was not looking for any sort of adventure that involved saving the planet from nuclear war. Infact, when he first contacted Joshua/WOPR via his odd, old school floppy disk and dial up rig, he was treating the interface as if it was a video game. It was only when he got a glimpse of the news, that he realized he was 'playing with fire', so to speak. 

David Lightman was immediately put off by the gravity of the situation, and pretended nothing had happened. Hoping it would go away, he was reluctant. And only after grasping the severity of the situation he caused, was he only able to undergo the quest of stopping the nuclear missles from being launched. David Lightman's character is also quite one-dimensional. It doesn't explain really why he has such a fascination with computers and the internet, and it doesn't explore the other facets of his character. As the reluctant hero, we don't know WHY he is reluctant, and spends so much time in his room. 

The characters I discussed have properties that make them "Stock" characters, but no, they are not interesting characters at all.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[David Lightman, the protagonist in the movie WarGames, is a somewhat interesting character at the same time, as he is only 17 years old, and possesses a vast knowledge of computer hacking and technology, although possessing the same mindset throughout the whole story. He is introduced as being a sneaky individual that is an avid computer hacker, as he knows where the school keeps their weekly password, he knows when to obtain it, and he is able to hack into the school computer system to change his grades. 
David Lightman is a hero in the movie, but not by choice. At first, his only intentions were to play games so he hacked into “Joshua,” an artificial intelligence program created by Dr. Stephen Falken. Only when Lightman realized that hiding from the problem that he started would do no good, and is caught by the government that he was able to start World War 3, did he decide to intervene and deactivate Joshua before it was too late. 
David Lightman is somewhat of an interesting character, as he is the protagonist in the story line, but his development is very one-sided. He is the one that caused the problem, and he is the one that fixes it in the end. He doesn’t do anything out of the ordinary, such as, betray the government, or cause the problem to escalate even further.

Dr. Stephen Falken, the anti-hero in the story, is a fascinating character in the story. When he is first introduced, he seems to be smart and interesting; as he created Joshua the computer program who is named after his son, and shortly after, “passes away” after Joshua was deemed futile, as it seemed he could not learn the difference between right and wrong. Throughout the movie, Lightman and Jennifer track down Falken; he is shown to be living by himself on a remote island. Falken sees himself as a failure because of Joshua, and does not seem to care for anything anymore even when Lightman and Jennifer explained to him that Joshua was able to start World War 3. However, as Lightman and Jennifer seem to have failed to convince Falken to assist them, Falken’s character development completely turns around, and he is more than willing to help them. This is captivating for the audience, but it never is explained why Falken suddenly had a change of heart, but the audience is given to speculate that Falken needed time to process what Lightman and Jennifer told him, and because of their words, decided to help them. 
Dr. Stephen Falken’s decision definitely played a key role in driving the story line forward, as Lightman might not have been able to deactivate Joshua without Falken’s help. Falken’s character turn-around certainly helped Lightman, and came to a positive outcome. 
Both David Lightman and Dr. Stephen Falken both have qualities that entitle them to be “Stock” characters, Lightman being the “Hero” and Falken being the “Anti-hero.” However, in character development, Lightman was one-sided as he always had the same mindset throughout the whole movie, thus making him less interesting than Falken, who had a complete character turn-around which drove the story forward, and helped Lightman come to a successful outcome, making Falken a more interesting character than Lightman, the main protagonist in the story.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[David Lightman’s Science Teacher


David’s science teacher in the opening scene can be described mean, scary, and belittling instructor to those students who don’t perform well. David arriving to class late set up the Science teacher for the typical scenario of handing back an exam to him with a bold letter “F” right on the front. Likewise, when giggly Jennifer is unable to answer the Science teachers question since she was clearly not paying attention (or genuinely did not know the answer) he is prompted to then hand back her exam to which also had the same bold letter “F” on the front. These two events help provide evidence he is a stock character because of his inability to change, or adopt a different reaction to essentially the same occurrence – he remains flat. Likewise, these events help drive the narrative forward since they give the viewer insight to David’s and Jennifer’s characters and how they might coincide throughout the rest of the movie. 

Jennifer Katherine Mack


Unlike the Science teacher, Jennifer Mack plays one of the main roles in Wargames. She acts as David’s love interest and helps him throughout the movie to. The stock elements that she initially possesses are that of a dumb and bubbly teenage girl, leading to the suspicion that she might not have too much to offer for the development of the film. We see Jennifer though, near the beginning of the movie to be undecided of the help that David is trying to give her by changing her Home Economics on the districts computer system that he’s hacked onto. She seemed hesitant and didn’t want him to enable her cheating at first, but the next time we see her character she is asking politely for him to be of her assistance. I think this ties up with the film very well because it shows Jennifer’s roundness, and hints that she will evolve further as it goes on.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The protagonist of Wargames, David Lightman, bears a stark resemblance to Ethan Levin of The Bug. They are similar in that both men are on a quest to stop something harmful. The early events of the movie lead David in a hot pursuit to stop Joshua(the WOPR’s artificial intelligence). Believing Joshua to be just a simple game, David begins playing global thermonuclear war. However, this causes the United States military into believing that the Russians are firing nuclear missiles. In the novel, Ethan Levin is in his own pursuit. His aim is to bring down a computer bug that freezes the whole program, jeopardizing the company. 
The character of David Lightman is a very interesting one. He is a very intelligent hacker with the knowledge on how to change his own school grades. David looks like the typical high school kid who just slacks off in school. He has no urgency in focusing on his school work; however, he does spend a lot of time on his microcomputer hacking into programs. The assumption of David is that watching tv or hanging out with friends is what peaks his interest. The opposite of that happens in the movie as he spends a vast amount of time on his microcomputer hacking or looking into whatever he wants. This is evident when he tries to use his computer to find information on a set of forthcoming computer games. A scene with David’s high school classmate Jennifer also points out to his different type of personality. As David tries to walk across to his computer, Jennifer blocks his legs in between hers. The classic assumption is that David might make a romantic move on Jennifer, but he does not. David does not have the stereotypical character-type of a guy who just wants to make out with girls. The movie tries to play out that something might happen in this situation but it does not. The relationship of David and Jennifer only culminates later on in the movie. Throughout this movie, it is evident that David is not a stereotypical nerd. He is intelligent, but not in the way most of us might think.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Mr. Liggett
David Lightman’s science teacher is introduced in one of the first scenes. He represents the stereotypical high school teacher no student likes. He comes off with a condescending attitude and he fails to show any compassion for his students. In the scene set in his classroom, David ends up arriving late for class and Mr. Liggett is shown to react sarcastically, ultimately poking fun at him. Likewise, by showing the entire class Jennifer’s failed test mark with a giant, red F, Mr. Liggett mentions that her unsatisfactory results are the outcome of her not paying attention in class. Although this may be true, it still is no way a teacher should behave with a student. His character in general is flat as he doesn’t contribute to the story in any significant way and neither does his character develop throughout the movie. The type of stock character he portrays, the rude, unpopular high school teacher, may add slight elements of humor for some but otherwise leave his character rather uninteresting. 
David Lightman
David Lightman plays the protagonist in the movie. He is an example of a character that starts off by getting himself in a conflict unknowingly, ends up trying to solve the problem he created and ultimately ends up saving the day. He represents the stereotypical stock character of a young, teenage geek who keeps to himself usually because he is too busy with his obsession of sorts (computers). Because of the conflict associated around his character, I think it makes him interesting and round due to the fact that he plays the problem creator in the beginning and the problem solver at the end.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The NORAD lady who announces the missile launch countdown is definitely a cause for suspense in the film. Her clear, calm, and yet commanding voice is a defining character trait that drives a great sense of urgency in her respective scenes. She indicates that time is rapidly running out and that in turn causes tension to build. The other characters, now extremely panicked, are pressured to resolve the problem of the world blowing up. Her character’s actions act as a vehicle for plot. She motivates the other characters to ‘make a move’, which is crucial to any story. In a way, she sparks suspicion in the audience about whether the missiles will actually launch. The NORAD lady’s calm voice and precision seems like the kind of stock character of a dutiful government controller. What makes her interesting is that she is actually terrified too. While her voice conveys that she is poise, her eyes say that she is petrified to be counting down to her potential death! She causes the building of friction- for rising action to occur just before the climax. She makes everyone else act desperately which keeps the audience entertained.

Jennifer Mack also sparks suspicion in the film. Her mysterious and flirtatious behaviour around David has the audience wondering whether some sort of romantic relationship will form between them. Her actions can be very provocative, but David is clueless to what she means. That leaves the audience thinking that the romantic link may not be exactly inevitable. David is the type of nerd hacker stock character that is blind to pretty girls like Jennifer Mack. Which leads me to identify that Jennifer Mack as a stereotypical dumb pretty girl. Malak, in the comments above, points out how Jennifer may seem like a round character when she initially resists David when he changes her Science mark and then changes her mind. This is also an example of why she is interesting despite her stock characteristics. The audience thinks she has a heart of gold by doing the right thing (and is crazy enough to be content with an F), BUT when she changes her mind, people begin to reconsider their stance on her character. We find out she is fun and awesome, but also quite a badass- which is proven to be an incredibly intriguing character trait!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The corporal in the infirmary (cannot recall his name, if mentioned) that was supposed to keep a watch for David Lightman as he was held for questioning represents a stereotypical stock character. He is the type of character that is trusted to guard the door and make sure David, in this case, is where he is meant to be; the carelessness of this character leads to a roadblock for the FBI agents. Instead of keeping his mind focused on the task at hand, the corporal sees the opportunity to flirt with the pretty woman who also works there. His neglect and lack of attentiveness ultimately lead to David's escape, all while he was striking out with the blonde woman on the computer. David's escape causes suspense for the viewer, allowing the minds to wander, it also moves the plot along and makes it a little more dramatic (Will David be caught? The movie could have ended much quicker if the corporal paid attention. What will happen next?)

As many have already mentioned, David Lightman is also the stock character type. The computer nerd, intelligent but prioritizes his hacking abilities over school work (hence having to change his grades) He is more focused on finding new video games than spending time with a girl, and avoids taking responsibility of the fiasco he caused by hacking into the 'game' until it is almost too late. 
Lightman, and Levin share some similar and very different qualities. They both wanted to stop what they unintentionally started. Lightman with the war game he thought he was playing, Levin with the bug he thought he created. Lightman was able to live to see his doing be fixed, showing character growth. From an ignorant young boy to someone who understands the consequences of his actions, fixing them before it's too late. On the other hand, Levin's character disintegrated as the novel progressed. From a prestigious programmer to a broken man ending his own life as a consequence to all the doings he wasn't able to fix. Both characters are intelligent, and have a thorough knowledge of technology, coding and hacking but only one succeeds to finish to have their happy ending.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Lightman’s Science Teacher:
Lightman’s Science Teacher is a stock character because he is shown as what a typical high school science teacher would be in most movies. His students do not pay attention in his class as most of are receiving rather low marks and are having their own conversations. Lightman’s science teacher embarrasses him and his fellow classmate Jennifer Mack, so when the Lightman makes a joke about him, it can be understood that the relationship between his student and himself is the same. Since he does not enjoy them not paying attention in his class and would prefer to not have them in his class and they do not want to be in his class as well. However, the stock character that Lightman’s teacher represents allows the viewer to understand Lightman from another perspective. One may pick out the fact that Lightman received a low mark in his biology class and does not wish to participate in it that much since it is hinted that is always sent to detention by the same teacher. But when he is smart enough to change his mark for that biology course so one may perceive that he may just be a lazy person. This is also proven false in the film when Lightman takes the time and effort of trying to find the number of the game company so that he could hack the company and play the games before the program was even released. So from this one can suggest that Lightman is not dumb or lazy but he has no interest in that course. Lightman allows us to understand how exactly his science teacher is stock character between the student teacher relationship they share. Lightman’s science is an uninteresting character as he only has a small role in the movie and is mostly there just to let the person watching the film understand a bit about Lightman’s background.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Someone watching the movie would describe David Lightman at the beginning to be what we would describe as a typical hacker. He was lonely, didn't have many friends, genius with computers and was always looking for new things to hack into. These are some of the traits that David possessed and which made his characteristics like a stock characters. What makes David interesting is that normally we would think of hackers as being geeky, or timid and shy but David isn't necessarily like that. When he found out what he had hacked into he decided instead of hanging out in the background he would try and stop Joshua and become the hero in the movie, which isn't a typical stock trait of a hacker.

David Lightmans specific character traits of a hacker start the story off and create the conflict in the first place but he is also the way the movie moves forward. At first he wants to impress the girl, Jennifer Mack, by hacking into the school's data base and changing their grades. Then he moves on to trying to impress her even more by showing her that he can hack into larger companies, or so he thought. When he found out he was the reason that their country was on the brink of a nuclear war, his character traits changed and he became more of the hero type. He escapes from the guards under lock down by being smart and using technology to his advantage, then he gets out and searches for Dr. Stephen Fawlken to come help him stop Joshua, since he was the one that programmed it in the first place. With David's changes in personality the movie was able to move forward. If he had stayed the same guy and not change from a hacker personality type to a hero, then the movie would not have ended the same, most likely the war wouldn't have been stopped.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Jennifer Mack

Jennifer Mack’s personality traits create suspense in the movie. First, she seems like a silly typical teenager that doesn’t take things seriously as we see her joking around with the biology teacher. Typical teenager stereotypes include rebellious, trouble-making, lazy and immature. That’s the stock element of her personality and I thought that’s who she is going to be throughout the movie. She changes throughout the movie, she is willing to help her love interest David and trying to stop Joshua from her country being blown up. This shows that she is not lazy and thoughtful, different from her stock characteristics. 

David Lightman vs Ethan

David Lightman’s character is very interesting. At the beginning of the movie, seeing that he has failed his biology exam, I assume that he is either lazy or not smart. When he starts hacking through his school’s grading system and the game about wars, we see that he is very intelligent and so focused in what he is doing because he is obsessed with hacking since it’s so interesting to him. He prioritizes his hacking (his interest) over school, Jennifer and spending time with family. At the end. I feel like his character does change a bit. He went from fiddling and hacking to something dangerous that he is unaware of and then trying to fix Joshua so his country/ or the world will not blow up. I think at the end through David’s experience, he sees that technology can cause severe consequences because technology is more than what you’re dealing with. David is similar to the Bug’s Ethan Levin, who prioritize the Jester over his girlfriend and other social relationship. Ethan is obsessed in one thing, “the Jester” like David with his hacking. Although these two characters have similar stock character elements such as nerdy, busy with their “interests” and highly intelligent, they also are different from another. Ethan is lonely, shy (or quiet), insecure and pessimist while David on the other hand is silly (when he jokes with the biology teacher and hack to play games) and not as depressed.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Mr. Liggett, David Lightman’s science teacher, is a stock character in the movie. He is not a fully rounded character and serves the purpose to further the development of David Lightman’s character. The science teacher is a flat character and is a strict and unforgiving teacher that is not very fond of David. The bitterness towards the main character shapes the way David is seen and portrayed as at school. Mr. Liggett is a teacher that not many students are a fan of and is not necessarily a fun character in the movie. His character plays a very minor role in the movie. The science teacher is not further developed through the movie as he does not appear very evidently throughout the film. This is why Mr. Liggett is a flat stock character in this movie.

David Lightman is the main character and the protagonist throughout the movie. David is a round character that is an intelligent young boy with no ambition. He is a lazy student and is snarky with his teachers. David is a hacker and decides to hack into a program so that he can play a video game. Ultimately, David causes the problem of potential world war 3. David becomes the hero in the story as he has to work to solve the problem that he created. However, David’s attitude towards the whole situation is more of a bitter outlook. As a result of David’s lazy persona, he is reluctant to help and does not want to be involved in the situation any more than he already is. As soon as David realizes the intensity of the situation, he decides that he has to help and has to move somewhere else other than his room to hack into the program and prevent the war.]]></wp:comment_content>

Good post about the movie, I accidentally watched the belated sequel WarGames: The Dead Code but they generally follow the same story line.

It's interesting that you described her in that way because in the 2008 version she is the smart, witty, "know-it-all" type of girl but similarly she does also play the boys love interest. 

In the movie I watched Annie plays the role of Jennifer and she sounds like she has the same role and characteristics.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[There are many factors that can drive a narrative forward, for example, Dr. Falken's lack of sympathy and hope for humanity inadvertently put everyone at risk for a major world war. His own personal  struggle with himself lead to  a standstill in the operation to deactivate a computer program, of artificial intelligence, named  "Joshua" from possibly starting an all our war.  When David and Jennifer convinced  Dr. Falken to help stop the capable machine, the whole plot turned around and Dr. Falken and David Lightman combine their intelligence to stop the computer. Dr. Falken is a round character with a back story, he changes throughout the movie to become one of the two heroes.  
 
David Lightman is a very typical  slacker, nerdy, video gaming teenage boy that qualifies to be categorized under  "nerd". Like most teenagers , he is alienated from his parents as they have no clue about his life. David is very intelligent with computers, his knowledge with them goes beyond an average person and he is very talented with hacking, as it is safe to assume he was self taught. His knowledge created conflict but also solved it, it is very suspenseful. What makes David interesting is the fact that he had the ability to solve things but doesn’t apply his super genius skills to school as we see in the first part of the movie, David has no desire to succeed despite his talents. This makes everything interesting especially David because no one expects a low achieving teenage boy to save the world from destruction. It is expected to have a big buff hero in a movie but it is never expected that a "nerd" would.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[David Lightman is not your typical “geek”; although he loves video games and computer hacking, David actually prevails to be a pretty sociable dude. In the beginning of the film, David comes running into the classroom late, making jokes about the teacher, leading him to be sent down to the principal’s office; where David and his principal discuss his “behavior problem”. In a way, David can also be characterized as a “bad boy”. He gets sent down to the principal’s office a lot, which means he likes to act silly and doesn’t really care about school. His grades are not that good either, considering he hacks into the schools network to change his failing grade into a "C". The ladies love him; well one in particular, a “queen bee” named Jennifer Macs, who likes David’s humor and admires his strange computer skills.
	What really drives the narrative forward is when David becomes over obsessive, as he tries to hack into the war games hard drive. He digs deep into his research and doesn’t sleep or go to school until he cracks the password. This reminds me of Ethan Levin’s character in the novel “The Bug”, when Ethan becomes over obsessed with trying to fix the bug and when he fails it completely ruins him. If David didn’t figure out the password, it would of probably would of ruined him too. 

	Dr. Stephen Falken, when introduced in his documentary seemed like a very intelligent man and a creator, who loved computer programming. He was passionate about his work and proud of Joshua. When David and Jennifer found him in his secret hideout, although he was still intelligent, he was no longer proud of Joshua or interested in knowing about what was going on. He did not have the intent or ambition to help David save the world. Falken can be stock characterized as a “Stingy man” because he did not want to contribute and wanted to the world end. Dr. Stephen drove the narrative forward when he came to his senses and helped take David and Jennifer to the headquarters to help disable Joshua. The mysteriousness of Falken made the film more suspenseful, by thinking they were doomed until he returned with a helicopter, ready to help.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Dr. John McKittrick, the guy who introduced the computer machine WHOPR, a computer program to react to impending threats of nuclear war to protect the USA, to NORAD is a flat character. From the beginning to end, he is an angry, determined, and confident character. He possesses a stock element of a professor: intelligent, scientist figure, inventor, etc. Moreover, his angry and bold personality creates an atmosphere of suspense, especially in the part where WHOPR played a simulation game of nuclear war between the USSR and the US. The on-going conflict between him and the general has created a division between pro-computers and anti-computers running the nuclear defence system. General Beringer's antagonistic and pessimistic role in the movie has created an interesting conflict. He embodies a stereotyped general figure well: all knowing, mocking, scornfulness, and portrayal of authority.

From observations, the assumptions about character types are bourne out through the text. The character types in stories/movies/novels is what drives the story along to a more interesting topics and arguments. Character types play a vital role in building up the story, just as important as setting.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Dr. Stephen Falken was portrayed as the crazy scientist who believed that all life must come to an end at some point. He comes off as being villainous to some degree but then has an epiphany to help the kids get back to the base and help David stop Joshua. He is portrayed as the mad scientist because his work with the computer ended for various personal reasons which is used to make him seem unstable and socially inept. He eventually is forced to come to his senses by David and takes them to the base to help Joshua/WORP to understand that there is no winning side to the game he is playing. 

Lightman’s Science Teacher is a classic stock character of a teacher. This is because the professor is shown as not putting up with the students and having a mutual hate relationship between the students and him. He is portrayed as the teacher that will send all the students who miss behave to the principal’s office and will not tolerate students that do not have the right answers. 

David Lightman and Ethan Levin have a few similar characteristics and traits which include their idea to not attend the situation right away and to see if the problem will correct itself. Both are dedicated to fixing the problem and in their missions to fix the problem they in turn changed with their task.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Dr. Stephen Falken causes a great amount of suspense in War Games because he it seemed that he is the only one who could stop the nuclear war. David couldn’t figure out how to stop the computer so he went to find Dr. Falken to save the world, but despite Davids pleading, Dr. Falken wouldn’t help. Dr. Falken was also driving the narrative forward when doing this. The story would have been cut short if he had just went along and fixed the computer. The fact that Dr. Falken couldn’t even fix the computer when he finally decided to help David caused more suspense. This delay in saving the world was a great way to bring more action to the story and make the movie less predictable.

	Dr. Falken is a stock mad scientist who has come up with a revolutionary product that seems will change the world for the better. Despite this stock character trait, Dr. Falken doesn’t actually initially try and help save the world from his product. . A normal stock scientist usually feels the guilt of his creation is does his best to fix it. And furthermore, when he decides to help, he couldn’t even figure out how to fix it. This makes Dr. Falkens character quite interesting because it leaves the audience on edge about what his next move will be.

	David Lightman and Ethan Levin have the same qualities of stock nerd characters but they also have a lot of differences. David does not succeed very well in school, but he is a very smart boy. He really enjoys playing around with his computer and hacking into sites. He is actually very personable for a nerd and he even attracts a girl. Ethan went down a different path. He succeeded in school and almost got his PhD, but he could not solve a simple bug. Ethan does not like computer programming and when the stress of work became too intense. Faced with conflict Ethan begins to break down to the point where he can’t solve the solution. He was also so distant from his girlfriend that she ended up cheating on him. David and Ethan show how characters can have the same stock character traits, but be very different.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[David Lightman one of the main characters and the protagonist is seen as a care free, intelligent  yet under achieving teen who spends his time playing games in an arcade and hacking into systems on his computer. David is portrayed as intelligent but lazy, care free and rebellious as he has smart remarks for his teacher and is constantly in the principal’s office. He also changes his grades by hacking into the computer system which shows his intelligence yet laziness. All these traits that David possess cause suspense as David’s intelligence and computer hacking skills are the only way that can stop “Joshua” in the game “Global Thermonuclear War.” At the beginning David is seen as a carefree teen who just wants to have fun, but drives the narrative forward by becoming obsessed with hacking into a system in which he can play games. This leads to him to playing the game “Global Thermonuclear War” with “Joshua.” This potentially starts a war that ultimately only David can finish. David’s character then changes as he seems more serious and caring.

David Lightman has similar traits like Ethan Levin as they both are seen as intelligent, Ethan a programmer and David who likes to hack into systems. Both can be seen as obsessive, Ethan who is obsessed with the Bug and David when he kept trying to hack into the system to play games.


David Lightman’s science teacher is seen as a typical science teacher, from his appearance to the way he acts in the movie. He is portrayed as the serious teacher that is not liked by his students. This is evident as characters David makes remarks to him and is sent to the principals office. David Wightman’s science teacher is a stock character because there are no changes in his character throughout the movie.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[So for this weeks Movie Module, I mistakenly watched the wrong WarGames Movie. We were supposed to watch the 1983 movie but I watched the recent one, “WarGames: The Dead Code” which is a belated sequel to the original shot in 1983.

Will Farmer (who is similar to David Lightman in the 1983 movie) also plays the protagonist in the movie. Will is the smart, kind, generous, young man. Right away I knew the entire movie would be based around him solving or breaking a code that seemed to be impossible. He’s a high school student and right away has more knowledge about hacking, and fixing bugs than a regular teenage boy. He’s introduced to computers by his old neighbor who has continuous computer problems and each time Will fixes the problem, about two days later the computer is hacked again.

As the movie goes on Will finds out that he the government has something to do with it and a game called “Ripley” and he tries to stop whatever they are up to. His personality caused the suspense through out the entire movie because he was so driven to destroy Ripley; he kind of took us on a crazy adventure with him. I found him very quick and smart with whatever situation was thrown his way.

Another character I found was interesting who in my movie didn’t have the biggest role was Joshua. Joshua was a programmed game but in the end helps defeat Ripley. He’s a major/central character as he is vital to the development and resolution of the conflict that takes place throughout the story line. Joshua is a minor character but serves qualities to complement Will. 

Will is more of a “stock” character, he’s exciting and gives the movie suspense and I could tell right away, although some stock characteristics can be boring I found Will to be a good example of a stock character.

Characterization for a story or movie allows us to empathize with the antagonist or protagonist so that we can feel what is happening to them is happening to us as well. It helps bring out their motives (which in this case is to destroy Ripley and “beat the game”).  Overall, I really enjoyed the movie! I’d recommend it for those who enjoyed the 1983 version!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[David's mother felt like a stock character to me. She was the hardworking, busy and distracted real estate agent doubling as a mother who probably didn't pay as much attention to him as David would've appreciated. It seemed that all they cared about were his grades and since David was able to hack that system himself, there would be no issues with his mother or father. They mentioned something about their son spending a lot of time in his room but then the phone calls begin and his mother is back to focusing on work.

With regards to Ethan Levin, he and David are both consumed with problems that start as something small and harmless and then grow into serious life threatening issues. For Ethan it was his mental well being and the collapse of Telligensia and for David it was the nuclear war that he unknowingly declared as he thought it was just a game. Both these characters have tenacious attitudes towards their technologies- they get completely obsessed with solving code. Ethan gets so obsessed that he loses his mind and eventually commits suicide and David continues to hack into the computer and into Joshua to get access to a video game. They both are relentless and stock nerdy characters.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Malvin

For those who might not remember, Malvin was the man in the glasses who took the paper away from Jim. He had a very high pitch voice and a noisy personality. When Malvin first makes an appearance in the movie he was socially awkward for he places himself into the conversation between Jim and David. Malvin is a flat supporting character and due to his personality I quickly assumed he was a stock character, a nerd. His characteristic happened to remind me of another character that is quite similar from the show Big Bang Theory. That would be Sheldon Cooper. Sheldon and Malvin share multiple characteristic but what I found the most that resemble each other was that both think of themselves higher in intellect compared to others. When David asked how he should start his search Malvin was quick to respond “are you stupid” and “I got this all figured out”.  Malvin character traits also drove the narrative forward because without Malvin suggestion of how to start the search, David wouldn’t have been able to continue. 

David Lightman

David Lightman is the protagonist in the movie. I thought he was a very interesting character. He’s a young boy with knowledge of computers and hacking that most boys his age have no idea about. He first came as lazy, due to him changing his grades and showing up late to class, but throughout the story I soon to learn that David isn’t a lazy man. He put a lot of effort and work to access what he thought was a game and to fix his mistake. Although he might not double bag the garbage to keep his dog out, David is a hardworker.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I really appreciate your thoughts on the differences between Lightman and Levin. Lightman definitely seemed to be better able to adapt and bounce back from set-backs than Levin.. kind of an interesting comparison between someone young, who has the whole world in front of him versus someone who's in the process of getting chewed up by the processes of life events and being unable to cope without the sort of optimism a young person feels with their life still bright and full of promise. 
(I also like that you brought up the officer in the infirmery... although he really made me uncomfortable with his creepy/sexual harassment approach to trying to woo the nurse)]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[David Lightman, is the main dynamic character as he essential to the development and solution of the conflict and his personality changed as the movie move forward. In beginning of the movie, the main personal characteristics of David were a teen not doing well at school and likes playing arcade video games. While he messing around his computer trying to hack to video games, by chance he hacked in to WOPR and he started to play one of the listed game called Global Thermonuclear War. Dived discovered  that he wasn’t playing but unknown he hacked a top-secret military system that helps the Air Force decide what to do in the event of a Soviet attack. Soon, David personality change and he tried to fix the problems by searches for Dr. Stephen Fawlken to ask for his help. David is the protagonist personality in the movie as he started as irresponsible teen creates a big problem ending to be a hero trying his best to solve it.  
  WOPR or Joshua is an interesting character in the movie (maybe the antagonist) although it’s a computer playing the game but its ads a lot off suspense and suspicion to the story. As Joshua was playing its simulating Soviet attacks on the US, and all the efforts which done by David (the hero) were to stop it.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I don't think that Stephen Falken was that hard to place into a category.. I'd say he was the eccentric genius/hermit crossed with an anti-hero complex... He was a genius, came up with a revolutionary idea of teaching a computer how to learn and run scenarios to predict outcomes, but when faced with personal tragedy he withdrew from the world and continued doing pet research projects ( like the pterodactyl remote controlled flying machine). He didn't want to be involved with the matters of the world, but his morality wouldn't just let him stand by when he was confronted with the fact that he could potentially save the world even though he didn't consider himself a part of that world anymore. 

The girl, Jennifer Mack, was definitely a stock character.. It was kind of neat that they showed a couple different kind of students that don't get good marks. Matthew Broderick's character was really smart, but seemed bored with school so he didn't apply himself, while Jennifer just didn't care for intellectual/academic pursuits at all and didn't apply herself. She was basically a girl-next-door, potentially a love interest but Broderick's character was too passionate about cracking the puzzle to pursue her until it's resolved. It seemed to me like she was mostly there to ask the questions the audience might have been asking about this new-fangled technology and what hacking was... and occasionally bail him out of a sticky spot. Perhaps that's pretty cynical of me.


I think a writer can utilize character tropes as tools to move the story in the way they want to... Using an old crone trope vs. a maiden would allow them to drive a story in a way that readers would either accept as in line with their assumptions about the lives of the characters and what choices they would make, or draw attention to the character by putting a twist in there. Such as how Ellen Ulman had Kat not behave in a way that one might expect a young woman to behave.. she is a big nerd, highly intelligent, and seemingly not interested in a long term relationship because of her work. Women are usually assumed to want to settle down and have a family or put a relationship before a career. I don't think that WarGames made any significant changes to the stock characters, and it didn't make the movie not entertaining, but it was pretty predictable as an 80's movie.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[General Beringer was a tough, confident character who always maintained his composure, even as a nuclear war seemed imminent. He was also computer illiterate, and preferred to use men instead of computers to launch the missiles, if it were necessary. He was also rational; he waited for the last possible second,to be sure it wasn't a real attack from the Russians. It seemed he could be the stereotypical overly aggressive military man, who would strike first and ask questions later, but proved to be otherwise. 

David's science teacher was condescending and enjoyed handing out poor grades to his students.He does not represent the stereotypical view of a teacher, that is, someone helpful and caring. 

Dr Stephen Falken: Initially cold, distant and unemotional, who had given up on life. Later in the story, he returns to the way he was depicted earlier in the movie, as caring and compassionate. David Lightman called him out on this, saying "I know you weren't always like this"-when he was being distant and cold at their first meeting.

Jennifer: Intelligent, but not in the same way that David Lightman was. She was book smart but not tech savvy, as she was didn't understand much of what David was doing with computers. She was also very curious  and inquisitive-always asking questions.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Joshua and WOPR are certainly different characters even though they call the machine by his name. Joshua is not too described in the movie except for the very fact that he is indeed Falken’s son and died at a young age. He is loved by his father so much that Falken named his prized invention after him. Ultimately, Joshua is the final answer, or should I say code, to enter in to the WOPR’s system, proving his importance to his father. He is the code to the back door as hackers would call it; leading the protagonist to open up the malevolent intelligence that is the WOPR. I am not too familiar about the specifics of what type of stock character Joshua could be, but I could say that he reminds me of Lily Potter. Lily protected Harry all these years with love and protection against the death that Voldemort was to set upon Harry. Similarly, Falken used his son’s name because of his love for his son like he loves his work. Moreover, Falken set Joshua as the barrier to protect himself from the dangers of what he had made, what the computer might bring, and also to protect his son from it (I might be straying off topic here bringing in Technophobia and Harry Potter, just trying to prove a point). 

WOPR on the other hand, is the independent computer that learns by experience. It is such an interesting character that it thinks on its own and knows who it works for. It was initially made to learn from what has been thought to it by Falken, yet in the end learns by itself. In the beginning you could tell that the movie makers made the character really suspicious, scary, and almost cringing to hear it talk once it did. It seemed that the year they made this movie was when computers started to be on the bandwagon. They show the frightening side of the character to let the watchers know that computers cannot be trusted. It surely created the conflict between the protagonist and the men in blue suites, and the machine. Also the machine reminds me of Ethan Levin. Both were very obsessive with winning, too focused, and knew they were witted. I actually enjoyed the movie; it had humour, and romance of course, even with its war commentaries, and quite the dark theme.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Nicole!

Thanks for recommending the 2008 version of the movie. I was supposed to watch it but decided to watched the 1983 version since the setting from what the trailer on Youtube showed appealed to me. It's great to know that the movie followed in on Joshua's character, he is like you have said, vital to the conflict in the movie. I would also recommend to you the 1983 version of the movie, you know how they say the originals are better?]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Throughout the movie War Games there are certain characters that drive the plot forward. David Lightman is a tech savvy seventeen year old boy who has a passion for computers. He is a stock character because he plays the role of a typical teenage boy. He doesn't try very hard in school, spends a lot of time on his computer, is quite the troublemaker, and doesn't have his priorities straight. Unlike most teenage boys, he finds a way to hack into the school system where he is able to change his and his classmates report card marks. Then he does sometime beyond the expectations of any stock character: he comes close to ending the world by hacking into War Games which he is at first under the impression that it is only a game but it turns out to be real and very serious. 

David's mischievous and sneaky personality causes suspense especially when he continues to do things such as running away from the police and the officials, hiding in not so secret locations, and frequently becoming very close to being caught. In one scene he manages to escape with a tour group and gets back on their bus to leave the grounds. It is suspenseful when he appears to get caught but it turns out an official was only impatiently reminding him to stay with the group.  

David and Ethan have quite a few things in common. They both work long and hard in an attempt to decode a computer system. Also, both Ethan and David's issues could potentially have an effect on a larger group of people. The Bug is at risk of jeopardizing the company and War Games puts the entire United States Military on alert as they believe the Soviets are going to attack with nuclear missiles. These life changing problems put an immense amount of pressure on both Ethan and David's characters.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[In the movie “War Games”, suspense and suspicion is often caused by the protagonist, David Lightman, who manages to keep the viewer on the edge of their seats for some particular scenes. David is surely a stock character as he can be seen as what some might call your typical teenage boy. In other words, he is a trouble maker at school, he does not seem to care about his grades, and he likes video games. However, there is one thing that stand out about David. He is extremely tech-savvy, and can even hack into his high school’s grading system to change his grades from D’s to C’s, B’s or even A’s. What makes him even more interesting to focus on is when he hacks into what he thinks is a computer game called “War Games”, although it is way more than just a game. Precisely, it is a program where you pick a country to target with missiles, appearing as if it were a game, but with real life consequences. When David realizes he has accidentally put the United States of America in jeopardy, he forgets about his lazy slacker attitude he always had in school, and embarks on a difficult adventure to save the future of his home country, where he demonstrates rarely seen before traits such as determination, unpredictability, and problem solving.

Another stock character is David’s science teacher, who picks favourites (David is not one of them), is very serious, and likes to pick on people who misbehave in class, namely David who arrives late, and has his own side discussions while the teacher is talking. This leads his teacher to publicly announce to the class that David received an F on his exam. Although the teacher is only in one scene, he does not appear to have any characteristics that make him out to be different than the viewer would expect, and does not have any contribution to the plot or outcome of this film, making the viewer forget about him almost immediately after his scene ends.]]></wp:comment_content>

In the beginning of the novel, it appears that Clay has a lot to learn from the wise, bookkeeper Mr. Penumbra, but when Clay solves the Founder’s Puzzle through his 3-D model replica of the bookstore, Penumbra suspects that using computers might be a faster way to solve the codex vitae; therefore, leading them to encoding key of immortality.

<strong>   The nature of Clay and Penumbra’s relationship is that both of them have something to learn from one another. Going along with the theme of old knowledge verses new knowledge, Penumbra teaches Clay about old knowledge (the codex vitaes and the Unbroken Spine) and Clay teaches Penumbra about new knowledge (computers and technology).</strong> Penumbra helps Clay drive the narrative by introducing him to the waybacklist and informing him about the Festina Lente Company and the secret book lover’s fellowship. The two then works together as partners, along with other computer wizards to try to decipher the code by using Google.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[You have a really good thesis for the relationship of Clay and Penumbra, along with supportive information. However, I would recommend you put your thesis at the end of the first paragraph instead of the beginning of the second paragraph, but that’s just me. Be sure to revise for grammatical errors and add some more information by expanding on key ideas a bit more in detail, it seems a bit too short. Also, I think you you dived right into the plot of the story at the beginning of the introduction, maybe start with a  hook to capture the readers attention.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[You have a good starting point for a thesis. It needs to be focused a bit more. You might consider discarding the old knowledge / new knowledge dichotomy because it clouds the point of that sentence. In other words, what you're really asking yourself here is what are they learning from each other? Try to pin that down and work from there--then you'll have a really clear sentence that can guide you in finding some evidence of what they are looking for. There's a lot to cover in the sentence as it is, so you'll want to refine the approach as you find examples.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I have to agree with DNW, that you should pick one thing they learn from each other and really expand on any evidence found. From there you could ask why that exchanged information is important or what it means to the overall story. Furthermore, the first paragraph summarizes the novel more than anything. It does kind of set up where you are going with the essay, however, you should focus more on the exchange of knowledge between the characters and less on minor factual like Clay is the main character who encounters Penumbra, who introduces Clay… and so on. Instead, dive right into what you want to say. We all know what you’re talking about, so go ahead and explain why their exchange of knowledge is important! ]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The draft here is very clear and makes sense. The comparison between old and new knowledge and then using them together by learning from each other is a great point and has a lot to work with for an essay. It seems you might be writing a few run-on sentences. The first paragraph has only two sentences maybe split some into smaller sentences. Didn't find any other syntactical or grammatical errors other than that though good work.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I find your thesis is interesting: old technology versus new technology. It’s something we all can understand when we are reading the book and something we can all relate to. I think that your first sentence is a bit hard to follow, maybe shorten a bit (it’s a little bit too long). However you provide a good short summary about the book as your introduction. How about providing a hook so you can engage the audience about your essay? And then you can start your summary from there (or out it in your body paragraphs). I also agree with Jordan, you should put your thesis at the end of your introduction paragraph so it can lead to your body paragraphs better.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Reading Week Module: Interpretation and Encryption -- Themes!!</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We've entered the second half of the course. As a result, we will be turning a little more forcefully toward the analysis and discussion of <a href="http://literarydevices.net/theme/" target="_blank">themes</a>. In particular, we'll be looking at <a href="http://literarydevices.net/theme/" target="_blank">themes</a> that coalesce around representations of people interacting with technology and the broader cultural, physical, and emotional world that accompanies the representation of people interacting with technology. 

This module should help you become more familiar with what exactly constitutes a theme. In other words, what is a theme and how is it helpful to understand texts using themes or, more excitingly, how do themes in texts help us understand the world?

<a href="http://literarydevices.net/theme/" target="_blank">Themes</a> help us to place texts in intelligent spaces so that we can properly relate them, or decode them. We're trying to understand how texts are encrypted and how we might better interpret what's useful about them--this includes our own work / writing, or even the profession we choose to enter. There's not much in the world that doesn't involve some kind of interpretation, decryption and encryption. 

This module, unlike the others, requires a good deal of work on your own. Try to understand what a theme is and then make a judgement about what you think the theme might be. There can be multiple themes in one text, so there's no "right" answer that you're looking for--you are trying to identify in the poem's content, or in its form (that one is important), some relationship to technology and/or its representation in a cultural, artistic, or social way (or not!). 

For this week's module. You need to do 5 things:

<ol>
<li>Read <a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/source/agrippa.asp" target="_blank">William Gibson's poem Agrippa</a> and the <a href="http://agrippa.english.ucsb.edu/category/the-book-subcategories/the-poem" target="_blank">accompanying context pages</a></li>
<li>Read and <a href="http://www.continentcontinent.cc/index.php/continent/article/view/97" target="_blank">download this .pdf from Ishac Bertram</a> that gives a few examples of "code poems."</li>
<li>Read Elizabeth Bishop: <a href="http://allpoetry.com/poem/8493577-Sestina-by-Elizabeth-Bishop" target="_blank">"Sestina"</a></li>
<li>Read E. E. Cummings: <a href="http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-g-r" target="_blank">"r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r"</a> and <a href="http://poetry-fromthehart.blogspot.ca/2011/06/ee-cummings-la.html" target="_blank">"1(a"</a></li>
<li>Okay, so you've read a few poems, now, for Friday Feb. 13th, think about some of the <a href="http://literarydevices.net/theme/" target="_blank">themes</a> that might come out of reading these poems and <strong>write in your suggestions in the comment space below before Friday Feb. 13, 2015</strong>. These <a href="http://literarydevices.net/theme/" target="_blank">themes</a> can be gut reactions -- like "confusion" for example, or "I understand the ones that are not in code." The idea here is to capture your reaction to the poem's content--as much as you can get at the meaning of the poem.</li></ol>

Check back here on Friday for the second half of the module.

<strong>MAKE SURE YOU STUDY FOR YOUR EXAM!!!</strong>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think time is a minor theme in the poem “Agrippa” by William Gibson. Moments in time are evident by photographs and using these photographs, people decode the image to understand what happened while the photo was taken.

Collectively, all the code poems suggest that people everywhere around the world struggle with the same problems at some point in time. Underlying our differences, people are very much the same species. While reading “DAILYGRIND” in particular, I took away the idea of routine. That people’s days begin, they go about their lives, their day ends. Boredom from the repetition of routine is a common problem in many people’s lives.

While reading “TWOFACED”, I recognized that people’s thoughts can contrast with what they are saying. The facade of kindness can mask what people are really thinking in day-to-day life.

Elizabeth Bishop’s “Sestina” was a more interesting and challenging poems in terms of theme. I did take away the theme of coincidence. The grandmother believes that the almanac foretold the rainfall and that she herself was going to cry, but that could have very well just been an accident. The almanac relays historical information that indicates what is likely or could happen in the future, but by no means predict the future.

In both E.E. Cummings’ “r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r” and “l)a” both suggest that reading is a form of decoding. Initially its difficult to understand what the words are even saying until you connect the letters or rearrange them. The visual structure of each poem threw me off, but after later contemplation gave meaning to the poems. For instance, in “r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r”, some of the jumbled up letters make little sense, but after rearranging them they read ‘grasshopper’. In addition, the obscure letters mixed with symbols are similar the movement of grasshoppers- hopping and jumping and never staying in one place too long. In “l(a”, the poem looks like a bunch of letters, but after connecting the letters, I deciphered that is said “l(a leaf falls)oneliness”. The idea of loneliness is emphasized by the title, what the poem spells out, having the word ‘one’ present in a line and the structure of the poem looking like a 1.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[It is quite probable that memory is one of the themes contained in the poem "Agrippa." Memory that got awakened when Gibson finally unties the old black book titled "ALBUMS CA. AGRIPPA" (2nd stanza). I've also noticed how descriptive he gets when he sees the pictures. He starts off recollecting his memories from 1919 about his "'pappa's sawmill," to his mother, dog, old house, etc, until he aged through the years. When he comments about the "mechanism" could it be possible that he's referring it to the mechanism of how pictures are taken and how pictures flood the mind with memories?

The code poems are brilliant. I've never seen anything like it before. Code poems are playful. In particular, I really like "TWOFACED" because it's humorous and at the same time reflective of reality. Many of us even realize this truth that being two faced is genetically programmed in us. 

"Sestina" recycles the same words. Majority of what it's about is still undecipherable for me, but the description is vivid and somewhat has a gloomy environment. The "r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r" and the "[l(a]" are both really confusing. The codes or disarranged letters makes it hard to be understandable. In "[l(a]," I can see three words— "leaf falling," "loneliness," and "oneliness." (l (a le af fa ll s) one l iness).]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The theme for the poem “Agrippa” could be memory, as the poem refers to the speaker opening a “black book” to look at photos. Observing the photos could be a way to reflect on the memories of the speaker and his feelings towards the history of the photos.

After reading the code poems I was extremely frustrated as I did not understand what the themes of poems were. But what I did take from reading the code poems was that both codes and poems are similar in that they both meant to express ideas and have meaning. Referring back to the source module we did the codes in the page source all had meant something and were in specific parts of the page for a reason. Just like the poems “r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r” and “l)a” the structure is important to express the meaning of the poems.

As I read the poem “Sestina” I noticed that objects are personified as a human.  For instance the lines “is watching the teakettle's small hard tears dance like mad on the hot black stove.”  Also the  object almanac is “clever” i  the third stanza it states “hangs up the clever almanac.” And in the last stanza it portrays the almanac to speak in the line “ Time to plant tears, says the almanac.” To me the theme to this poem could be personification of objects.

After reading both “r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r” and “l)a”  several times and becoming more confused I turned to google for help. From there I realized that the poem’s letters needed to be rearranged. The letters r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r turns out to be grasshopper and is the poem numerous times, even after rearranging the letters I did not really understand the poem but believe the theme is about structure and form.  When you lay out the lines horizontally in the peom “1)a” the letters connect and form the words “a leaf falls” and “loneliness.” The theme to poem is similar to the poem “r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r” as the structure and form are important and needed to “decode” the words.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[There is no shortage of evidence that the poem "The Agrippa Files" by William Gibson is about the longing for memories that are  enclosed in the photographs mentioned. Throughout the poem the author wrote a lot about past experiences, lives of family members, the description of the present and past. The poem has a dark sentimental vibe to it that makes readers feel a certain type of way. 

The code poems are quite interesting and well done in my eyes. I feel like the poems are about character and the lack of care we put in our lives as well as the lack of care of others.  Code poems such as "Unhandled Love", "Daily grind" and "Two Faced" has a malicious ambiance to it.  "Unhandled Love" was a tragic short poem about the non- appreciation of love, it kind of confused me, questions such as: Who /What are you voiding? What is the main? Are you talking about a person? From working too hard in "Daily Grind" and not taking care of yourself gives a sense of selflessness in character but also a lack of care towards the self. "Two Faced" is just plain malicious, it shows a lack of character and the lack of morality. 

"Sestina'' by author Elizabeth Bishop was a thought provoking poem. The theme appeared to be about the essence of time and the effects it may have. The grandmother grows old and grows some what feeble in her mind while the young granddaughter has oblivious and light thoughts. The grandmother is clearly unhappy, trapped in her own thoughts of helplessness. It could be the cause of a seasonal affective disorder and the weather, everything might seem to move slower in time.


The poems "r-pop-h-e-s-s-a-a-g-e-r" and "[(1a]" by E.E Cummings seems to be a puzzle of some sort but analyzing the poem over again produced no solid link. This poem's purpose could be to confuse it's readers as a different form of artistic poetry. It could be just a fun poem that leaves the reader plenty of time to use their imagination. The theme could be about the limitless possibilities poetry and literature can inhibit. 

Overall, I feel like the purpose of the poems were meant to be decoded and analyzed by the reader, some themes were dark and some were playful.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[For the first poem, “Agrippa,” the main theme is memories. Gibson writes about a character reliving there past memories with their family through the photo album. The theme is evident when the character is explaining what is happening in each image of the album, letting the reader know of his or her family’s story. However, I did not understand the symbolism for the mechanism or how it helps support theme.
I could barely understand what exactly code poems by Bertram were saying, let alone find a specific theme that linked them all together. The only I was able to understand was “TWOFACED” because it was the simplest of all the other poems. It did not have many symbols that distracted you from what the context was saying. Also the concept of being two faced is something that is so common that it requires little thought to understand what the poem was suggesting. However, most of the other codes (poems) required a lot of thought to understand. One that was simpler than “TWOFACED” was “UNHANDLED LOVE” but with it being so simple I just could not decode that code.
The theme present in the poem, “Sestina” may be sadness or grief as everything in the poem has tears. The poem gives the reader a very gloomy feeling as even something as simple as the condensation of the kettle is described as though the kettle is a living being that cries. Towards the end of the novel, “the child draws a rigid house and a winding pathway,” this may be the grandmother’s house. The child most likely drew a house it was familiar to, therefore the man drawn on the house may have been familiar with the child as well. This man could have possible been the child’s grandfather who has passed away, hence why the grandmother feels the house chilly or why she everything in that house is crying. Therefore, this causes me to believe that the theme of the poem may be grief of a loved one.
The last two poems by E. E. Cummings were similar to the poems by Ishac Bertram in the sense that both poems were written as codes with symbols. The poem “[l(a]” was easier to understand compared to the first one by E. E. Cummings, as the second poem had been decoded by the blogger who had posted. But “r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r” was far too confusing for me to decode, so I could not find a theme for that one either.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[As it has been pointed out in previous comments, I too, believe memory plays a role in the theme for "AGRIPPA". As it goes through the book, the photographs allow to recreate the lost memories. Try and piece together what was going on when the pictures were taken. Continuing onto the Agrippa Files it is mentioned how a diskette was used to encrypt the book this could mean that it was meant to be 'lost' as the poem mentions in the beginning?
For the code poems it reminded me of our source code module and I immediately thought "great, more codes I won't understand" but as you look closer you're able to somewhat decipher these. "twofaced" was the most simple to 'decode' as it applies to almost everyone in one way or another. Saying one thing and meaning another also goes hand in hand with poems. Having to think is this what it really means or is there a subtle underlying meaning behind what is being said? You never really know what is going through the authors mind, unless specifically told.
The following two poems by E.E Cummings was frustrating to say the least. I was able to read (or make up a meaning)  "as we look upon....can be rearranged...grasshopper" but quite frankly it didn't make much sense to me. I assume you are supposed to rearrange the letters/words to make it into something understandable but I was unable to do so. And the only reason I was able to understand the second one "[l(a]" was due to the explanation at the bottom. These rely more on your visual senses than anything, piecing together parts of a puzzle to see the big picture is what is necessary to decipher them. 
Lastly, "Sestina" repeats the words at the end of the line and thanks to Google I found out that is partially the point of a "Sestina" poem. For this one, the vibe was more gloomy. The weather had an impact on it, and just how the scene was set up. It seemed as though the grandmother was missing/grieving the absence of someone (grandfather, son) maybe? As at the end "the child
puts in a man with buttons like tears
and shows it proudly to the grandmother." which makes the grandmother sad. The almanac may be showing a specific date or anniversary of something almost as though it is trusted to tell the future?]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Other Themes in Agrippa include industry and manufacturing (ex.woodworking). It appears the economy of the town of Wheeling, West Virginia, described in the poem, was historically strong in these resources.

As for Sestina, I believe that the use of personification creates a theme of fantasy, i.e objects interacting with humans. Or maybe the grandmother is losing her grip on reality and imagining these things, and so hallucinations are a theme.. I'm not entirely sure. 

Regarding the poems written in code, I think that twofaced represents societal expectations. By that I mean, we can think one thing of someone, but it is totally inappropriate to say exactly what we think of that person. This poem seems like something I would normally associate as a man encountering his ex-girlfriend/wife on the street and they are forced to talk. The others don't make a lot of sense to me, based on what I feel is lack of programming language knowledge.
As for E.E Cummings, those poems somewhat resemble how a computer might read a web page, or how programmers code web pages. The theme could be changing people's interpretations (by arranging words in a non-unorthodox way).]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[In the first poem, "Agrippa" the main themes that I got were nostalgia, death and war. These themes tie into each other and I found were the most dominant throughout the poem.

My initial reaction to the code poems were frustration and confusion. E.E. cummings poems make sense when you read them in a different order than just right to left. for 1)a after it was pointed out in the commentary I noticed I got some meaning from it when it was read vertically at once. I get confused when poems are in code because I don't know how to read it and the brackets and spaces confuse me. 
As for "sestina" I got the theme of tragedy and possibly tradition or the passing of knowledge. I found this poem and Agrippa the easiest to follow or take themes from due to their format and familiar language.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[In William Gibsons poem “Agrippa” there is a theme of memories through time. The Kodak photographs and the items described in the poem are the keys to the memories accompanied to the images. There is also a theme of travelling and wisdom in the poem, through the various scenes described in the poem and through the change of ages.  

I think it is really interesting that "Agrippa" has an encryption-like effect that makes the poem disappear which like the memories attached to the photographs described in the poem and his father, these parts of life disappear to those except for those who are determined to remember it. 

I really like this line in Continent in the introduction: the structure and function of these new languages give them special advantage in clarity. The Coded poems are really interesting and have the theme that language is transferable and that what is visible on the outside is not always what is being thought or visible on the inside. 

“Sestina” has a theme of patterns and the recognition that the process of one thing in the past will have the same or similar pattern in the present and future.  

“r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r” by EE Cummings is an interesting read because the copyright for the poem is 1923 which predates computers and computer codes. It is even more interesting because E.E Cummings poem reflects the coding patterns of computers. It is also a code to figure out and rearrange the orders of the letters into words and to figure out the meaning of the poem much like his other poem “1)a”. These two poems by E.E. Cummings are interesting because of the code theme and the assertion to themes and events that occur in daily life, like the thought and act of loneliness and oneliness.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The theme I found most evident in “Agrippa” is memories. The numerous dates though out the poem show the memories through the photo graphs. William Gibson uses these photos to symbolize a past memory or experience.

I found the coded poems really interesting and how the codes wordings followed a pattern. It’s a way of showing that almost anything can be poetic. I had trouble understanding the meaning behind most of the coded poems. The poem that really caught my attention was two-faced. We can see the two sides of the poem and have the coding was patterned to be opposite as well. 

I found Sestina to be a very depressing story. It starts off talking about September which is a stressful month with usually the start of school for most kids. The story continues to talk about things such as tears and rain and I believe is referring to themes such as sadness or sorrow with the grandmother.

When I first read r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r  and I have never been so confused in my life. As I continued to look over and over it I saw grasshopper at the end. I looked back through the poem to see that it seemed those same letters were mixed throughout it. Im not sure what the theme could be in this poem or if its more of a puzzle. With 1(a I used the same idea of mixing letters and saw the word loneliness. The one is separated from the liness which could be representing the theme of solitude.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[In Agrippa, the first thing I noticed is the use of descriptive words. The writer uses detailed description for the subject. Examples of these include chalk-like white pencil, the grass needs cutting, and the gun lay on the dusty carpet. The theme revolving around in this poem seems to be memory. He talks about his grandfathers past and what he did for a living. The author also writes quite a bit about the present. 
When I read the coded poems, I was really confused as to what they were talking about. I understood some parts, but the overall structure and themes were confusing. Maybe in Unhandled Love the theme is love? My confusion turned to a brief chuckle when I read Twofaced. The response to “Hi! So great to see you!”, was something that got me thinking what the codes meant. The “greet” might be this positive response while the “think” is a negative response in the person’s head. “Fucking bitch” is what the person might be thinking inside their head. 
  Sestina was a really descriptive poem to read. I am not quite clear as to what the theme might be, but the poem clearly revolves around the grandmother and child. I found that age may be something that the author is trying us to get across to. In one of the lines, the grandmother is feeling cold. As the grandmother puts wood into the stove, with crayons the child draws a rigid house. 
E.E. Cummings poems were very unique. The letters are rearranged in the first one and they are difficult to perceive. The only clear word I can see is “grasshoppers”. I can visualize the word grasshopper in my head but the other words are hard to identify. The second poem was easier to identify as their was a description. A leaf falls represents an action, or what is happening. When I look at it from this perspective, I feel that loneliness is the theme of this poem. Loneliness represents the single leaf falling. The description helps me understand how to LOOK and READ this poem. Without the description, there is only confusion.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I started off by reading the poems by Ishac Bertran. The poems contained symbols associated with code and I didn’t really understand the meaning behind them except for the poem, “Two Faced” which I actually found to be quite humorous.  
“Sestina” was a poem that had a certain feeling of sadness to it. Tears were used multiple times in the poem and in expressed in various forms and I think that may be why I jumped to thinking the poem related to themes of sadness or loneliness. 
The poems by E.E Cummings were different than the others due to the way they were structured. The poem “r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r” was confusing to say the least. However, I understood the gist of the poem as it started off with the letters of the word ‘grasshopper’ rearranged, and then the letters were rearranged again, and the last line  ‘ to rea(be)rran(com)gi(e)ngly ,grasshopper;’ just rearranged the letters yet again to form the word grasshopper. The second poem ‘- [l(a]’ had a theme related to perspective in my opinion because as a leaf falls, the tree becomes ‘lonely’ so to speak while the leaf gains independence, or freedom from the tree and achieves ‘oneliness’. 
The poem ‘Agrippa’ was also confusing to understand. The poem itself was like a story however I couldn’t really understand what the speaker was referring to. After reading the context pages, I learned more about the history behind the poem however it didn’t help me understand any new information about the poem.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[In the poem “Argippa”, William Gibson provides the reader with  a very lengthy poem which continuously hints out memories by writing with vivid descriptions that come with various different dates about a specific photo album. Perhaps this is the possible theme of the poem although there appears to be a deeper meaning. The poem includes additions, II, III, IV, V, and VI, which uses repetition of the word “mechanism”. I am confused as to what “mechanism” refers to in this poem but I believe that it is symbolism for a deeper meaning.

Out of the four poems that were written in code, I was not able to decipher them and pick out a theme for any of them. Even after rereading them a couple times, I was still confused. These poems really reminded me of the view source module because these poems honestly could have been the source code for a website, or at least in my mind they could have been. I was equally confused by the poem “r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r” by E. E. Cummings. It was written in a way that is similar to code, but not quite like the poems that resembled the source code of websites. The words of this poem were scattered all over the page. I did not understand why some words were on the left, some on the right, and the odd couple of words in the centre. The use of brackets only made me more curious as to what this poem is really about, because I highly doubt that it is just about a grasshopper. 

I thought that the poem “Sestina” by Elizabeth Bishop was a little mysterious. It is not clear to me why the grandmother is trying to hide her tears. Why is she trying to hide it, and what caused these tears? There is an abundance of personification that can be found in this poem in every single different stanza. I liked the writer’s use of personification, because it made me interpret the poem differently then I would have if inanimate objects like the almanac, stove and kettle were not given human emotions.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The theme in “r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r” is the process of decoding. The "“r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r”  poem at first makes no sense, but it guides you from the original garbled mess of letter,to the solution. Within the "r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r" grouping of letters, lies an embedded solution: which is "grass hopper". And perhaps the grasshopper is a metaphor for how we can "leap" from idea to idea, until we arrive at the conclusion. But I personally found a minor theme of disappearance in this poem aswell. When I first opened it, I truly had no idea what the title meant. Once I solved it, I always refer to it as "Grasshopper" when I see the mess of characters. I no longer can see it in the same light that I initially did, the "code" title was replaced with 'grasshopper', and I cannot revert back.

     The theme in "1(a"  is ambiguity in code. How the same thing may be interpreted differently, depending on it's structure. The entire poem delivers most of it's impact with HOW it is structured, not the words that it contains. If the poem just was laid out as:

     "1(a leaf falls) oneliness" 

     the code would of lost much of it's emotional impact. The code can be ambiguous, but the method of it's delivery may carry as much meaning as the code itself.

     In "The Agrippa", the medium is just as important as the words in delivering the theme. The poem would self-destruct, and cease to exist after it was read and displayed once. The theme of memory, how it just an imprint, is demonstrated here. Memory is just an imprint of time,and once the moment is gone, it disappears. Technology (photos, writing, painting) are ways of coding experience,memory, emotion into other forms.

The code (which is colors on paper - photographs) is deciphered by our mind to bring us back to a memory, an imprint of an event, in the past. 

     The theme in "TWO FACED" was Deceitful code. How "public string" can be modified to mask, or throw off, what is happening in "Private string".
I also noticed the structure: How the "Private string" falls underneath the public, as if it is a sub-script, running in the background.


The theme in "DAILY GRIND" is the boring repetition, and how the unemotional language of code can represent that best. Code is meant to seem as impersonal and indistinguishable as possible from any other programmer's work - as described in "The Bug". The medium is just as important as the content in this poem.

     The other two 'code poems' are unclear to me.I assume "UNHANDLED LOVE" is a reference to the function of "Handle" that a computer can carry out, but this poem seems to be written for an audience who is familiar with coding. I am not at all familiar with coding, so I do not have the 'key' for this poem or the other "DANCING WITHIN" code poem.

     Sestina is confusing to me aswell. There was so much focus on the stove, and almanac it really confused me as I was expecting a poem about technology. The poem assumes I know what an almanac even is - I googled it, it seems to be some sort of annual magazine. So this poem is obviously very old. 

     A possible theme I may have extracted is faith in technology. I realized how an almanac at that time was not considered 'old and how perhaps people thought that they may hold the ability to foretell the future - like how we believe technology can today.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The poem Agrippa describes someone uncovering memory after memory as they look back on their life. The speaker also describes his feelings towards these photos. This poem's theme has something to do with the speakers life story and all of the memories he or she has learned and grown from. 

The tone in Sestina is quite sad. The grandmother appears to be going through some sort of hardship and is easily brought to tears. It appears that she does not want to show her emotions to the child and therefore she makes an effort to distract herself form the realities. I think the theme is sorrow since there does not seem to be any uplifting or joyful moments whatsoever. 

I was not able to understand  or piece together any of the code poems. Although I do believe it would be a creative and intriguing task to construct a poem with certain letters and numbers each having a different meaning, I would probably explain my ideas and motives to my audience so that they would begin to see the meaning of the poem. For example, throughout some of the code poems several curly brackets are used which would at least make them somewhat significant. Similarly, after reading the final poem r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r I was extremely puzzled and did not know where to start in terms of finding themes for the poem. At first from seeing the word "grasshopper" at the end I thought that the poem might be telling a lesson to a child or just someone in need of advice. As a child my dad used to make jokes that I was a young grasshopper. This poem being written in code, could be deciphered differently by each person who comes across it. It takes some imagination and maybe personal experience to uncover the meaning.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think my comment is late, but I'll have a go at it anyway. 

The Agrippa files poem was very difficult to read, I found it easier to watch the video that someone posted in the context pages that showed the emulation of the program and read it that way. I think one of the themes was about time through generations of a family and their personal life. The imagery of the shutter falling signified the closing of periods in the writer's life, and the poem was organized with clear sections, like the chapters or phases of his life. I've tried thinking about how "the mechanism" factors into the theme, but haven't come to a theory yet. 

The code{poems} were pretty cool and clever. They seemed to be focused on the inner vs outer workings of certain aspects of daily life and the way people think. I loved Two Faced, it kind of reminded me of the module which we looked into the source code for different websites, and discovering all the secrets coders had left in there, I wonder what I'd find looking at the "source code" of people and seeing what really goes on in their heads, especially if it was arranged in that way. 

Sestina was nice, I hadn't come across that particular type of poetry before. I think it's about the struggle of womanhood. The almanac and how it mentions moons and "equinoctial tears" really makes me think of the cycles women go through during the course of their lives (menstruation, the maiden/mother/crone stuff). The grandmother has lived through them already and is looking at the child (presumably a girl) and seeing how she is starting to or will soon become effected by it. 

The two poems by E. E. Cummings were really cool as well, I liked how they were organized and that I had to read them over to glean meaning from them. "r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r" was really confusing, so I'm not sure if that's part of what the theme would be, but there must be more to it. I did notice that I was constantly required to re-arrange the letters and interpret what the brackets were meant to do, and it does say "rea(be)rran(com)gi(e)ngly"... "become" in the bracketed letters, and "rearrangingly" between those, so I guess it would be about decryption. I'm not good at anagrams, but I'm pretty sure there are a couple of those thrown in, because otherwise it has some utter nonsense. That could be part of the point, though. [l(a] was more straightforward for me, about loneliness and whether it is a bad thing or neutral. "loneliness" "a leaf falling" and "oneliness" are pretty serene ideas and don't really have anything polarizing about them. I think that the reader's personal experience with those images would greatly affect the meaning they take away from it.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[William Gibson’s “Agrippa” contains a theme of family history, a photo album, and the Kodak camera. Gibson returns to the main concepts of the numerous familiar memories that he describes throughout the text. It presents a sense of nostalgia and reminiscence of his past, relating it to the photo album and the camera that took the photos. 

Ishac Bertran’s project of code poems are so clever. Each poem is written in a different code language like Java, C++, and C#. In order to truly translate the poems, one would have to be well versed in that particular coding system. They seemed at first to be little more than a clutter of codes together but once you pay more attention, you can detect the patterns and meanings of the words and symbols. To me, they were examples of the flaws in humanity. “Dailygrind”, by Paul Illingworth, entertains the monotony of North American culture and the pain staking routines of the average person.  “Twofaced”, by Jason Kopylec also presents a certain fault in character that some individuals have, an act of “backstabbery”- acting as one person to one’s face and another behind their back. 

“Sestina”, by Elizabeth Bishop, could contain several different themes. I found that the most prominent was the sadness and gloomy vibes of the text. There was a constant stream of words like “tears, “failing light” and “rain falls”. Another theme that was extremely obvious was the reoccurring words in each verse. The same words were used in different ways. For example, “tears”, were referred to as the old grandmother’s tears, the teakettle’s tears, the “buttons like tears”, the “little moons falling down like tears”, and several others. The writer used the same process with Almanac, stove, house, child, and grandmother. 

E.E Cumming’s “R-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r” and [1(a] are incredible confusing to me and take a lot of time to deconstruct without reading the descriptions. I feel as though one would have to be quite experienced in order to fully understand their meanings. I do like, however, the fact that they are unique and complicated but at the same time they are simple in the fact that they can still easily get their point across. It’s as though both poems just want you to work for it. “[1(a]”, for me, presents a theme of loneliness while “R-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r” is a jumbled mess of words. The leap to becoming a grasshopper? It’s confusing and is a complete puzzle to solve. I love the idea that these project but it’s difficult to decipher.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I believe the theme of “AGRIPPA” is reflection. Now, having read a lot of the other comments on this module, it is safe to say that memories are another great underlying theme as well, however reflection made more sense to me. 


The photographs in the album serve as the memories, but memories are simply fragments of time if not interpreted further into something, or coded. Reflection is what occurs once memories have been thought about, or looked at, and transformed to have meaning in the present day. 

The code poems to me made a lot more sense than AGRIPPA, although still slightly frustrating. Unhandled Love, for instance, theme could have been forgetting. Initially, in the first line, we see “class love” there and present, but by the end love is thrown away, as if it never occurred. Dailygrind was a poem that was fairly relatable in the sense that it counted hours and minutes of time between being at work and being asleep. The theme for it is probably most simply, worklife. For the code poems, I think their themes are overly simplified because of the effort taken into decoding them. 

Finally, the EE Cummings’ poems were the ones that interested me the most. It took a bit of time, and creativity to figure out the literal words behind the syntax, but once unraveled the meaning behind them was clear. In “[l(a]” the words taken from it are “a leaf falls”, “loneliness” and “oneliness”. As mentioned by the response directly following the poem, the leaf falling is in between loneliness. “A” leaf, meaning one, falling from a tree of many leaves to the ground where it will then become “one” with the others, leads me to believe the theme of this poem is solitude as a form of being included. One cannot be a part of a greater entity without simply being one on its own. 

(Also, sorry for commenting so late in the game, I spent this reading week with the flu only to get an infection of sorts and put on antibiotics - only to have rare adverse side effects which sent me back to the doctors. Thanks for understanding!)]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[In the first poem “AGRIPPA”, I think it is about nostalgia because the poem keeps recalling memories in the past such as, “W.F. Gibson Jr. and something, comma, 1924” and "Papa's saw mill, Aug. 1919” because the years suggested that. Also the first few paragraphs describe a photo album book, so it seems like the narrator is looking back to his or her past. 
 The next poem “r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r” is  quite confusing  and did not understand the meaning of it. I think the author is trying to emphasize the structure of the poem which kind of reminds me of codes. I think the purpose of the poem is to play the reader and trying to confuse them because it is not common how a poem  is written that way. 
“Sestina” is quite a sad poem because I guess it’s the tone of it. For example, “She thinks that her equinoctial tears and the rain that beats on the roof of the house were both foretold by the almanac, but only known to a grandmother” and “But secretly, while the grandmother busies herself about the stove, the little moons fall down like tears”. This paragraph suggests that the grandmother is hiding her sadness from the child (the child might also be distracted by watching the tea kettle). Or it could be that the child does not understand what the grandmother going through. Like this quote, “Then the child 
puts in a man with buttons like tears and shows it proudly to the grandmother”. To the child, that picture represents a man with normal buttons but to the grandmother, she perceive that image as something tragic, a sad memory that was at one point, happened in her life. The poem by Bishop was really interesting because one can relate it to real life, not everyone could understand other people’s emotions. 
The code poem by Allen is very “artistic” kind of poem. Like the poem by E. E. Cummings, the author is emphasizing the structure of the poem. It structured literally like codes and I think it’s trying to provoke the reader that codes are confusing and something that non-programmers will never understand.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[As many other mentioned before me, Agrippa theme throughout the poem is memory; however, the poem was very confusing. While reading it I felt lost at times and confused to what the poem was trying to say. Other than that I came with a simple assumption the poem theme was memory with hints that were given throughout the poem. There could be a deeper meaning, but I wasn’t able to identify it.

The coded poem: DAILYGRIND, UNHANDLED LOVE, TWOFACED and DANCING WITHIN, were all about codes. Once again looking at code left me dumbfounded but I found this was easier to read than the earlier module we had. TWOFACED was my favorite out all the poems. The humour it presented was enjoyable and something everyone could relate too. 

The EE Cummings poems. What can I say? I thought it was very interesting with the way it was presented, but one must unravel the poem to understand its meaning. I felt the theme was to look at it at a different point a view like codes. The poem r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r was very confusing. I had absolutely no idea what it was trying to say and till I know I don’t get why it all over the place scattered -btw to whoever SBD is, the poem did an amazing job to confusing me-. 1(a was a lot easier to understand. At first it was confusing, but the visual of the poem really helps out the reader and the response below was great help. Both poems remind of me how confusing codes are but once you understand it’s fascinating. It’s a whole new world you never knew about.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The poems Sestina is the most I liked. I think it about a sad story due to death or loss of loved one and all the memory behind that.  There are a lot of symbols present the feeling of sad and lonely. Tea time that consider a social time all family members  gather, enjoy and chat, here there are only a sad  grandmother and a child  left alone. September is Fall month that is cold and sad, leaves fall and  rain  stand for the loss. The repeating of words like tears and house suggest that somebody was living  with them, but he was not there anymore. Tears suggest that there is tragedy or death could lead to tears in grandmother's eyes. The cup of tea which is “full of dark brown tears” suggest that the grandmother cried a lot for long preyed of time  because tea time remind her with her lost. “She thing the house feels chilly” stand for an empty house that was full one day, so there is no warm anymore. “Rigid house” stand for old strong hose that survive from attach or tragedy. The child draws for  “a man with buttons like tears with winding pathway” reflects  that somebody left and did not come back. I think the theme of this poem is  human mortality and the feeling surrounding that and it's more general as people could feel the same after tragedy loss.
The poems “r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r”, 1)a” and code poems  its attractive. It was written   in different stretcher and some code,  but it was hard to  get the theme behind without read about it in websites. I’m not sure what the theme could be, and why it was  written in this way, I found using the regular way of writing the poems even if using difficult symbols is much worthy and pretty.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The poems "Sestina" &amp; "1(a" were by far the most powerful to me, and while it took a while to decipher E. E. Cummings works, the short but sweet style of "1(a" really had an impact. Both had themes of a darker nature, with "Sestina" comparing tears to many different things leads me to think that the theme of this poem is one of sadness and loss, some sort of sad happening to create the tears. In "1(a" the reference to loneliness and a single falling leaf are repeating the same thing, a feeling of being alone, the only one et cetera. Good poem for Valentines Day (okay sorry - had to take a stab at the fruity holiday)]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[In William Gibson’s poem “Agrippa” is reflecting on memories. The poem had breaks between stanzas that were “II, III, IV, V, and VI” so perhaps the roman numerals can resemble how many steps there are to break the code. The phrase “mechanism itself” is a clue to there actually being meaning and a code beneath the words. From what I gather, maybe the dates and names “W.F Gibson Jr., 1924, Papa’s saw mill, Aug. 1919, Moko 1919, Aunt Fran and [obscured], Ford on Dixie 1917, Arthur and Ford fishing 1919, Ford Sr., Moma July, 1919, Moma and Mrs. Graham at fish hatchery 1919, cryptic mark: H.V.J.M.[?], Papas mill 1919, Ice Gorge at Wheeling 1917, Steamboat on Ohio River, Our Wytheville House Sept 1921, W.F Gibson 1921, Mama Jan. 1922, etc., combined give you the key. If you rearrange all the letters and numbers maybe it cracks a code or gives you the key to cracking it. The poem is based on Gibson’s memories, triggered by a series of photographs. It analyzes how mechanisms affect our perception of reality, while appearing as a mechanism, while at the same time it can be destroyed by one. 

While reading Ishac Bertram’s poems Daily Grind/Unhandled Love/Twofaced/Dancing Within” frustrated me immensely. I couldn’t “decode” them or even fully understand them. From what I could somewhat gather from the four poems was that they were underlying our differences but at the same time reflecting our reality. They represent our lack of care, drive, but also the boredom and frustration of routine?

I loved reading Elizabeth Bishop’s poem “Sestina” as it had a somber but also tender feeling. Picking out a theme from the poem was challenging.  The repeating pattern of the words “almanac, stove, house, child, tears and grandmother” to me maybe suggest that both the child and grandmother are left alone but yet they have each other and there is still love within the household. 

4. “r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r” by E.E. Cummings was so different and fun. Obviously when I first began reading it I was like “what the heck is r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r?!” and each time after the word was rearranged gave life to the poem I think. It’s clear that the poem was constructed to look confusing just as a code would be but it all has an underlying meaning which in my opinion may be relevant to humans. Making a connection that sometimes we (humans) jump from one idea to the next or one decision to the next and eventually we will get there and find our place? Just like the code in Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore, the code was confusing and the goal was to find it and have the key to an immortal life, but really the code is so simple and about friendship and love. 

[1(a)] may have been my favorite. The fact that you could gather more than one word/phrase from the words was brilliant. You can gather the word “loneliness” and “a leaf falls”. Not only is there meaning behind this but there it gives you a visual as well. A falling leaf suggests loneliness. Another word I picked out was “oneliness” which is I think means wholeness. So although the poem may be about loneliness it also may suggest of being whole or one with yourself or something.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The main theme of the first poem was reflection. The poem starts off introducing what seems like a photo album. “Agrippa” seemed to show the lives of the poet’s mother and father. The theme of reflection also included the passing of time through the album.
The code poems really took me by surprise. I was really interested in the format that the poem was laid out in. I think that it took creativity of a poem to a whole other level. At first I found it frustrating to decode the poems, but decoding got a little bit easier as I continued to read. 
Daily grind is about the Daily grind of life. One day goes by and another day starts the daily grind all over again. I found it interesting that the format of this coded poem was very computer like format. I think the layout could almost be similar to viewing the source code on a normal webpage but to a less extreme. 
Sestina was a cute but deep poem. I found this poem a little bit harder to decipher. I’m not really sure what to make out of the poem, however I did find that the mood of the poem was set at the beginning of the poem when the author described the setting. There was use of personification through the duration of the poem.
“r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r” was by far the hardest poem to decode. Once I was finally able to understand and pick out words from the poem I really thought it was very creative. The poem had the word leap spread across the page as a visual image for the actually meaning of the word. I was not able to pick out a theme. I just found that reading the poem from what I can understand was describing a grasshopper and what the grasshopper actual does.]]></wp:comment_content>

<ol>
<li>Choose one thematic element (i.e. hackers, technology, knowledge, friendship, race, the self, the quest, gaming, etc.) you think has relevance to one of the texts we have studied since Feb. 6, 2015. After refining the thematic element into something more manageable, show how the text comments on the characteristics of that theme. This question does not ask you to simply point out how a thematic element is present in a text; rather it asks you to show how the text portrays and comments on that thematic element. This question asks you to explore how the text defines your theme--or presents its characteristics--in a significant way.</li>

<li>Choosing one text we have encountered since Feb. 6, 2015, discuss the significance of ONE cultural OR literary OR social practice present in that text. You are being asked to reflect upon how the text represents or uses cultural OR literary OR social practices. You need a thesis that clearly articulates what the significance of the practice means to our reading of the text. For instance, how it influences our reception of the text. It’s not enough to simply point to the cultural / literary / or social practices present in the text, you must make a suggestion as to the significance of these practices and the context they provide for an interpretation of the text.</li>  
<li>Using one of the texts we have encountered since Feb. 6, 2015 as evidence, define the characteristics of digital culture. What is digital culture as you see it, using the texts we have encountered as evidence for that definition?</li></ol>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Reading Week Module II: Encoding / Decoding</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In case you haven't caught on, the Reading Week modules have been about the theme of encoding and decoding. If you haven't had a look at the earlier module, I suggest you <a href="http://digitalcultureslab.ca/hybrid1102/2015/02/10/reading-week-module-interpretation-and-encryption-themes/" target="_blank">go back</a> and have a look. I like starting the discussion of thematics with encoding and decoding for two reasons: 1) it's a nice way to think about interpretation or, how we interpret texts; 2) I like introducing first-year students to the ideas of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Hall_(cultural_theorist)" target="_blank">Stuart Hall</a> who I think offers us an interesting way to approach the act of interpretation in a digital age.   

Thanks to all those who engaged with the <a href="http://digitalcultureslab.ca/hybrid1102/2015/02/10/reading-week-module-interpretation-and-encryption-themes/" target="_blank">interpretation and encryption module</a> that threw down a little poetry for a change. It's clear from what I have seen from those who participated that we are on the cusp of a decent understanding for what a theme actually might be. However, most of you didn't really delve deeply enough--probably because I didn't ask you to so no hard feelings--into the back story of William Gibson's <em>Agrippa</em>. To sum it up real quick: he encrypted the poem, which was sold on a floppy disk only, so that it would only scroll by once and then lock; remaining forever encrypted and inaccessible unless one could decrypt thereafter. 

<em>Agrippa</em> is an interesting way of thinking about how we perceive the reception of creative texts. For instance, I am sure a lot of you watch or download torrents, stream American Netflix, or otherwise hack a system to access some kind of restricted content. This act is, in and of itself, an act of interpretation. You are figuring out, either on your own or through your network of enlightened contacts, how to reinterpret the restrictions placed upon the delivery system of the content you want to access. 

All of which brings up Stuart Hall. He is probably best known for a piece he wrote way back in 1973 entitled "Encoding / Decoding in the Television Discourse." You can go and find it if you're really keen, but looking at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoding/decoding_model_of_communication" target="_blank"> Wikipedia page</a> should suffice for now. The big takeaway is that there are three kinds of readers: 

<ul>
	<li>Dominant</li>
	<li>Negotiated</li>
	<li>Oppositional</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>The dominant reader decodes the text exactly as was intended. Now, as we have discussed in class, we can never be sure of the author's intentions, but we can usually agree on a kind of surface reading that everyone takes from the text. For instance, we all agree that <em>Agrippa</em> is about memory, or that "r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r" is about a grasshopper. In class, I have always used the "cat" reference. We all understand bascially what a cat is. The dominant reading of a text is what most people would understand it to be about.</li>
	<li>The negotiating reader decodes the texts by negotiating between the dominant reading and one that suits his / her own interests or aims. You guys do this all the time when you listen to me lecture. You hear me talk about the definition of character and setting and narrative, but you are also interested in how knowing about character and setting and narrative will get you an A. Most of you understand the terms only insofar as they will get you an A. You negotiate between knowing what everyone knows about character, but you clearly reject some of the examples or explanations I give because they are not relevant to what you will be tested on. We frequently read texts this way; we believe most of what a character talks about, but something about how they say it for instance makes us suspicious of his/her motivations. in short, we negotiate between the dominant meaning--a cat--and the meaning we have--my cat is yellow so I picture not just a cat, but a yellow cat--my cat.</li>
	<li>The oppositional reader can decode the dominant message, but chooses to reject that meaning because it doesn't really apply to his/her social, economic or cultural situation. Also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistant_reading" target="_blank">resistant reading</a>, the oppositional approach does things like question the representation of gender or sexuality and challenges the cultural assumptions represented in the text. We might apply an oppositional reading to a TV show like the <em>Brady Bunch</em> that idealizes a family dynamic, but at the same time seems to condone divorce. We might also perform an oppositional reading if we are not inclined toward heterosexuality--two cowboys in the isolation of the desert playing with each others guns or two women caressing each other's underwear in an advertisement might have entirely different possible readings than the intended literal meaning (if you're giggling right now over the last two examples, you're doing oppositional reading). Oppositional reading then still decodes the literal meaning, but it rejects it in favour of another perspective based on a different cultural, economic, or social viewpoint.</li></ul>
	
OK. Phew. Now that we're through that here's what I want you to do:

<ol>
<li>Reread <a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/source/agrippa.asp" target="_blank">William Gibson&#8217;s poem Agrippa</a> and the <a href="http://agrippa.english.ucsb.edu/category/the-book-subcategories/the-poem" target="_blank">accompanying context pages</a></li>
<li>Reread and <a href="http://www.continentcontinent.cc/index.php/continent/article/view/97" target="_blank">download this .pdf from Ishac Bertram</a> that gives a few examples of &#8220;code poems.&#8221;</li>
<li>Reread Elizabeth Bishop: <a href="http://allpoetry.com/poem/8493577-Sestina-by-Elizabeth-Bishop" target="_blank">&#8220;Sestina&#8221;</a></li>
<li>Reread E. E. Cummings: <a href="http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-g-r" target="_blank">&#8220;r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r&#8221;</a> and <a href="http://poetry-fromthehart.blogspot.ca/2011/06/ee-cummings-la.html" target="_blank">&#8220;1(a&#8221;</a></li>
<li>Now, revisit the themes you recognized in the poems--the ones you wrote about in the comments--and try to EXPLAIN how your reading was dominant, negotiated, or oppositional. Then, take one of the examples above and try to read it in either a negotiated or oppositional way, writing about your conclusions in the comments below.</li>
</ol>

Notice how each of Stuart Hall's readers always knows the literal meaning. It's important to lay out this context when you are writing about or interpreting texts. If you explain the dominant reader's perspective, and then show how you read it "differently" then you're doing good things. If you simply show me the dominant reading, that's okay but it's not too thoughtful. Doing the exercise I lay out above should help you understand how the dominant or literal meaning of a text can lead you into interesting interpretations that move past the basic "understanding" or the text and into the "application" of the text that you need to show in post-secondary contexts.

<strong>Finally, a word about the exam. The exam content can include anything up to this module. Make sure you are aware of the parameters so you are not surprised. The exam can, and will, ask you about anything from Jan. 7th through to Feb. 16th, 2015.</strong>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[In my previous module, I felt that memory was the theme for Agrippa, and loneliness was the theme for l(a. I recognized the word grasshopper in r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r, but I was unclear as to what the theme was. Now that I take a look at it, maybe the theme is grasshopper? It is the main topic of the poem but I am not quite sure if a subject can be a theme. I hope I get some clarification on themes next class. Even for the other poems, I was not quite clear on the themes. 
My readings for Agrippa and r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r were dominant as I understood what the text was about. I did not understand each line of these poems but I knew what the text was referring to. When I read r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r, I rearrange the letters and I see the word grasshopper. The word grasshopper is rearranged in 3 lines and it is spelled correctly on the last line. Furthermore, if you read the second last line it says “rearrange” in scrambled letters. This gives me a huge reference as to what I should do with some words in the poem. When I read Agrippa, past references lead me to believe the poem centers on memory. I recognize that past tense references to the grandfather. For example, when David refers to a cat, I recognize what he is talking about. For these poems, I do not understand the bottom line of what the author is trying to say but I understand what he is attributing to. The surface of what the poems are about is clear, but the actual narratives lead me to some confusion. In l(a, I felt loneliness was the key word from this poem. “A leaf falls” represents an action for one single leaf. In this case, I see the leaf as lonely. When I read the whole poem, I feel that loneliness is what this poem is about. 
When I re-read Agrippa, I found two examples of reading the oppositional way. Half way through the poem, the writer talks about accidently discharging a gun. The writer is “absolutely alone and in awareness of the mechanism.” This means that he knows how the gun works. He is aware and has experienced how the weapon works. The next line says, “like the first time you put your mouth on a women.” I easily see this as a reference to sex or kissing a women, but the writer is referring to how it feels like to shoot a gun your first time.  Another example is in the text “spreading out to where the long trucks groaned.” This text makes me imagine an actual truck groaning, however, the writer is referring to the trucks engine sound. People often use the word “groan” with people’s reactions, but in this example the truck is not actually grunting or whining. I had to really look for this second example as it was not as easy to find as the first one. In my opinion, reading the oppositional way is interesting in the sense that we often use it with sexual related dialogue.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I agree with you, that "rearrange" is a hint. I actually totally skipped over that when reading the poem and didn't notice it. "Leap" stood out to me much more. You noticing "rearrange" , being very literal, and me noticing "Leap", (being symbolic in my intepretation) demonstrates dominant vs negotiated reading in practice. 

	My reading was dominant for “r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r” as I tried to figure out the theme.  I would be able to pick up on grasshopper, in “r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r” but I tried relating that to the course concepts. At first dominant, (Grasshopper) I attempted to go further say that the theme of the poem was to outline the “process” of decoding (negotiated).  When I revisited this poem again, with the intent on having a negotiated perspective I began to see the Grasshopper as a metaphor. This is indicated to me by “Leap” and “Arriving”. Grasshopper is a metaphor for the mind decoding and jumping to a conclusion.
 
 An example I recall from a class discussion is how Academic Grades can be a code. Such as A, A, ,A+,B.A- . The seemingly meaningless assortment of letters is ‘code’, and our mind ‘decodes’ it, and leaps to the conclusion “this person is smart”
 	With “TWO-FACED”  I had a dominant perspective of reading. I realized the theme was about hiding one’s true thoughts. Publically, the greeting is polite and proper. Privately, the thoughts contrast with vulgarity rudeness.  
 	When I revisit this poem, with a negotiating perspective, the format of the poem stands out much more to me. Being written in code, “Hi! So great to see you!” represents the generic. “Private String” represents the true, decoded thought that has to be ‘coded’ into publically acceptable speech.  Assigning myself a stance on the material, such as negotiated, allowed me to be more conscious of the relationship to this poem to the setting of the course. Instead of just thinking  “This poem is about being two faced. Done” I tried to relate it to previous concepts we described, and the theme of technology in the course.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I found that in “Agrippa” I was more of a dominant reader finding that it was about memory and I found it hard to decode further into it because the message of memories in the form of photographs was so dominant in the text. Whereas when I read the code poems in “Continent”, I was trying to decipher what the meaning of the punctuation and the ordering of the words had meant to the author and how I interpreted them. 

I was able to decode and rearrange most of the words in “r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r” and “1(a” by E.E Cummings. Rereading “r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r” I noticed that it was more about change and role models due to the idea of becoming and looking up too. “1(a” has more of a theme of self-reflection. Rereading these, I found that it was more in a negotiating reading style than a dominant or oppositional way.

I think that I am more of a negotiating reader because as I had read the texts I found that it was hard to differentiate between what I found the text to mean and what the most likely meaning of the text was. I found that my own thoughts, views, and values gave the text a different meaning than what the author probably meant and what others in the class would think about the same text.

An example of where I had read in a negotiating style is in TWOFACED by Jason Kopylec in a Java coding I read the poem as how the author had intended it due to the title of being twofaced and in a public environment. What I had to debate in the poem was the use of the term class. I found it to at first mean a social class but also to mean in a class setting such as one at a public school or college or university. I found that I was trying to differentiate between what the text actually was trying to say because of what the speaker is saying to what they are thinking and how it can be applied to both the social class and to be in an actual physical class.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Good comments both. I would add that "dominant" or "negotiated" or "oppositional" do not require any understanding of the author's intentions per se. Rather, they require that you get the basic, literal meaning, without any of the underlying interpretations. 

What's crucial is how this might lead you to a theme. So, taking "Grasshopper" (we'll go with that title for clarity, but it's not correct) into account, we might think about how Cummings is representing the natural world and the random, chaotic elements of it through poetry. 

For <em>Agrippa</em>, and this is why I directed you to the backstory about encryption, we're looking at a theme of memory and access. In other words, our memories are often encrypted by our cultural experiences. I know a picture of my father in an entirely different way than you do. Those specifics go a long way to illustrating the "encoding / decoding" concepts of interpretation. I would read a picture of my family based on my cultural assumptions and experiences with my family, but you would read that same picture in an entirely different way, often framing it within YOUR family experiences (negotiated reading) or with your cultural experiences (you are adopted, say, which would lead to an oppositional reading). All of which pressure my dominant reading and give you more ways to talk about memory, family, and so on. 

The idea here is that technology is a theme, but "encryption" is a better theme to discuss <em>The Bug</em> or <em>Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore</em>. There are also a number of different ways to think about "encryption" (Stuart Hall gives us three possible approaches for instance). 

That's what we're going for here in a nutshell; the literal meaning gives us a broad category, but it's our job to look and negotiate a reading based on how we approach the text and what we approach it with. We narrow the focus to something more manageable.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Of all the poems that I have read, "Agrippa" stands out to be the most obvious to me. As previously mentioned, "Agrippa's" theme revolves around memories from the photographs the author is examining. For this poem, I categorize this as dominant reading for reasons of repetitive reference to what he sees in the photos. The author's descriptions of what he sees in the photos paints a vivid image in the my mind. The photos stand out to me as a representation of the memories encoded in each pixels of every photographs he viewed, and that I can easily relate to his experience of retrieving memories from photos.

The “r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r” is also dominant reading because towards the end of the line it gives the reader a clue with what to do with the poem to make sense of it— simply rearrange the words it "becomes... grasshopper." Although at the same time, this can also be categorized as negotiated because a reader can reason that the poem is not all about the grasshopper. As I try to decipher the “r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r” in a negotiated way, I can say that this poem is about how us, about our daily life. There are times when we feel like we are out of order or disorganized like the words “r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r,” but in the end, we "become rearrangingly" okay. The disarranged letters and words caught my attention and interest more than the word grasshopper which led me to compare how this poem is laid out and what life is.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[My reading of “Agrippa”, the code poems, “r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r”, and “l(a” was more dominant probably because the themes were more obvious and clearly relatable. I find no reason to reject their meaning or interpret the poem differently in a more interesting way. Perhaps, I am a brainwashed drone who understands poetry in only one way… Anyhow, the literal meaning of these poems strike me as the most important.

I like to think I interpreted “Sestina” with a negotiating perspective because the poem is more open to interpretation (and it took me a long time to think of my ‘original’ idea). The idea of coincidence comes to me because the poem has all the repeated words throughout it. It seems kind of ironic. The repeated words of a sestina are by no means accidental, but the story suggests that some events seem to be predicted, but are actually just coincidental.

When reading “TWOFACED” again, in a negotiated way, I can’t help but relate the poem to good ol’ Harvey Dent. Watching a lot of Batman movies growing up has influenced me to connect themes that play on appearance vs. reality/public vs. private to characters and similar themes in Batman. Gotham’s very own two-faced villain, is a very public figure who is initially an awesome district attorney, but becomes the city’s worst nightmare. Harvey Dent is literally a public representative of government whose job is to fight for justice against major crimes. However, the evil things Dent does in private is exactly what his job as DA is set out to eradicate. On another note, even the parentheses in the poem look like coins which are signature to Dent’s character as he flips them to make major decisions.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[My interpretatations of the readings were negotiated, in such a way in that they are likely related to my background and/or interests. For example, in Sestina, whereas some people talked about loneliness as a theme-which makes sense given the reference to tears, I had another alternative. I believe that my themes of imagination, and/or hallucinations, could be strongly influenced by the many classes in psychology, including abnormal psychology, that I have taken. To give an example, I look at the way the poem mentions "Time to plant tears, says the almanac"-as a sign of a possible psychological disorder, such as schizophrenia. Also, the way the grandmother "sings to the stove"-communicating with inanimate objects.Therefore, my background and interests are probably guiding the way I decode these readings.
Another example relates to AGRIPPA. I mentioned the themes of manufacturing/woodworking, as I noticed they were mentioned several times. This may be a reflection of my interests, as well as my background as I spent a few years working in a sawmill-which is another word mentioned specifically more than once in this poem. Looking back at my original answers for themes, I now believe I have a better understanding of why I answered in such a way.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I agree with you Brian! When having previous knowledge on a topic such the theme of sadness and sorrow in Sestina, my mind imediately went to some sort of depression or other mental health issue. Therefore I think we are both taking on the role of a negotiating reader since we understand the text (dominant reader) but we want to relate the information in the text to our interests and previous experiences as well.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I read the poem Agrippa as a dominant reader since I understood the message and had a similar response to my peers. I recognized that the person in the poem was uncovering photos that each represented memories through his or her lifetime. Out of all four of the poems, I certainly was able to decipher this poem very easily as I did not have to reread it several times as I had to for a some of the other ones. 

Coincidentally I have read the poem Sestina before, only I have read it in another language and sung it with my choir. It is because of this that I read this poem as a negotiating reader since I also bring previous knowledge to the table by just reading the title. It was a very emotional piece for us all to sing and we often brought the audience to tears. The word "tears" is used several times throughout the text which emphasizes that the grandmother is experiencing pain and suffering. 

I think I Bertram's code poems take a certain kind of person to have the patience and determination to solve the mystery of the meaning. It is for that reason that I believe I read this poem as a oppositional reader since I feel I am quite resistant to it. I do enjoy reading poetry but when it comes to the point where it is a challenge to discover the intended meaning let alone decoding the literary terms I tend to give up.  

When reading E.E. Cummings poems I identified the overall meanings prominently. It stood out at me that 1a) is about loneliness since the word is formed in the last few stanzas. The poem r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r likewise, seemed quite simple to me to recognize the overall meaning was about a grasshopper. Thus, I read this poem as a dominant reader because E.E. Cummings clearly intended for the audience to grasp this concept.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[For the poem “Two Faced” by Ishac Bertran, I demonstrated dominant reading. I understood what the poem’s message was in a literal sense as it describes what happens in one’s mind versus what one’s visible behaviour is. 
For the poem “Sestina”, I demonstrated dominant reading. I understood the underlying theme of sadness through the repetition of ‘tears’ and the actions of the grandmother. 
For the poems by E.E Cummings, I demonstrated dominant reading as well as negotiating reading. It is clear that one of the poems is about grasshoppers and the other poem is about a falling leaf. However, both the poems are also structured uniquely and I think that their structure plays a role in what I believe to be a theme of perspective. 
For the poem “Agrippa”, I was initially quite confused as to what the theme was.  However, after reading the poem again, I picked up on memory as playing a part of the poem’s overall theme which demonstrates dominant reading. 
After attempting to read the poem “Sestina” in a negotiating manner, I can associate death to it as well. The drawing that the child makes of a man with buttons like tears could be of the grandfather who passed away. Also, the house seems chilly to the grandmother perhaps due to loneliness. Likewise, September could be the time of the year when the grandfather passed away thus signalling a tough time which is why the almanac says it’s ‘time to plant tears’. By using details mentioned in the poem, I can become a negotiating reader in order to further interpret the themes and meaning behind the poem.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I found this module quite frustrating due to the fact that I do not understand poetry very well or the meanings behind many of them. I feel I was more of a dominant reader while going through "Agrippa" because I was able to grasp the literal sense of it; memory. This goes along with most of them, especially the code poems since I took more of a literal meaning to them but not much else. Not being able to decode them for other than what they were intentionally. Also not knowing the authors intentions for it but being curious as to what they might mean and how it relates to what we've been discussing leads to more of a mix of a dominant and negotiating reader.
     If reading "Sestina" as a dominant reader, I would take the literal meaning of the text and in this case might conclude that this elderly woman is crazy, talking to inanimate objects, acting strange, living in a creepy house. On the other hand, as a negotiating reader I would be more interested in tying it into grief, loneliness as my first thought was that this woman lost someone beloved, and the signs of the chilly atmosphere was to emphasize the unhappy, grieving mood she is in.
Overall, I think I am a mix between a dominant (only getting the literal meaning intended) and a negotiating (adding my opinion/thought process of what is useful) reader in some instances.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I read the poem “Agrippa” as a dominant reader. As each stanza was about a different photograph in the photo album, i interpreted it exactly as it was written to me. Each stanza created different imagery for me, but the imagery was all in a picture. Although I stated that there was probably a deeper meaning, I was not able to look past the obvious, because reading this poem was just like flipping through an old and memorable photo album.

Reading the poem “Sestina” made me read like a negotiating reader. The first time i read through it, i had already programmed my mind to look for the theme of the poem, since that is what the previous module suggested for us to do. Since I did this, I unintentionally closed my mind to noticing other distinct things about the poem. After having it read it the first time and realizing that maybe I had read it too quickly due to the fact that I did not fully understand it, I read it a second time. The second time, I read it more slowly and didn't try to narrow my focus on finding anything specific. By broadening my mind, I then discovered all the personification present in the poem and the changing effect it had on the reader.

I read the poems, “Daily Grind”, “Unhandled Love”, “Twofaced” and “Dancing Within” as an oppositional reader. What these four poems all share in common is the style in which they are written, known as code. These code poems appeared extremely difficult to understand and interpret at a first glance. Even after having read them once or twice, I could not decipher any hidden meaning or themes. Apart from understanding what individual sentences and words meant, I was unable to piece it all together, making me reject the coding style. Similarly, the poem “r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r” was written in a unique way, kind of like coding, but not entirely. It took me a few times to realize that the title, was a rearrangement of the word “grasshopper”.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Make sure you take into account the context of <em>Agrippa</em>, Romney. It was originally encrypted so that one could only read it (or see it) once and then the poem was hidden from view unless you could decrypt it. Knowing this, think about how that would complicate your reading -- you were not told that the poem would encrypt itself when you bought it. Would the poem's meanings be so "obvious" if you read it once? What would it mean to your interpretation that the poem was locked down? Why would the poem do that? 

Trying to answer these kinds of questions gets you out of the "I read it this way" kind of comment that's above and into the more analytical comment that begins, "now, if I read it this way under the conditions of the poem's publication, what would that be like and why is that important to how I understood the poem?"]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Breanne, your comments around the Sestina are bang on a negotiated reading. You might think about how the meaning of the poem is different or comes across differently when it is sung. Is there something about the singing that makes the poem's meaning different? 

Also, remember that simplicity does not necessarily mean you read it dominantly. You could read oppositionally and still THINK you are reading it literally. That's what makes the "encoding / decoding" things so interesting. You don't KNOW you are reading it oppositionally until someone gives you an alternative. Like the saying: A fish does not know water exists until it is beached.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Try to phrase things not in terms of what you did -- "I demonstrated a dominant reading" -- but instead frame things around why that is important. I don't need to know the "what" you did; I need to know "why" and then most importantly why that is important to the reading of the poem, or the interpretive possibilities that are locked in the poem. 

The more you direct your thinking away from "this is how I read it" toward "this is why I read it like I did" the better off you will be offering an interpretation of the text that carries some weight and offers an application of the knowledge you possess.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[You might be frustrated because you are conflating two different things. The literal sense of <em>Agrippa</em> is NOT memory--that's an interpretation of what the poem is about. The literal reading is that it is an individual looking over a photo album filled with pictures that have meaning to him/her. You are negotiating the "memory" part and that is the "meaning behind" the poem.

Often, students are too intimidated by poetry--you have the interpretation already set and then think it's too easy so it cannot be correct. But, if you keep Stuart Hall's ideas in mind, and take your "dominant" reading as the "old woman is crazy," you might ask the following questions: what words in the poem suggest that she is crazy? How is that a dominant reading--in other words, saying she's crazy is an interpretation and it needs support from the poem. The second you do that, you are negotiating the reading to some extent. Something from your own sense of things--a gut feeling--has told you she's crazy. You're job in textual analysis is to point out some evidence that supports that gut feeling so it seems more valid. It's not just a hunch, but a substantiated argument. 

Stop trying to peg yourself as "dominant" or "negotiated" and instead think about HOW you read the texts and HOW and WHY you read them the way you do.]]></wp:comment_content>

I just wanted to comment on the poem "Sestina" and your comments about it. I googled sestina and found out more about it. I find it really cool that you already had some background knowledge about the poem to begin with especially in another language. 

The way I interpreted the text and the reoccurrence of the word "tears" was in fact suggesting that the grandmother and child were in some type of pain and the tears symbolized their mourning.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[While I was reading “Agrippa” it’s clear looking back that I was reading it as a dominant reader. The poem wanted me to realize that yes, this poem is in fact about memory. I think I was also probably reading it a bit as a negotiating reader. I felt I negotiated between the dominant reading and what my own interest in the poem was. For example when I said that the poem was based on memories that were triggered by a series of photographs and that it analyzes how mechanisms affect our perception of reality. A photograph, which can symbolize a mechanism, triggers our memory of what once was but at the same time it can destroy it. Reading that poem I think anyone can make their own connections to what the theme is which are memories, good and bad. 

I think reading Bertram’s poems the “Daily Grind/Unhandled Love/Twofaced/Dancing Within” I was being an oppositional reader. I couldn’t gather or figure out some of the themes or how they all connected to one another (which was frustrating) but I think it was because non of the themes never applied to me so I just rejected the entire poem and it’s meaning. 

The only poem that I could clearly gather meaning of was Bertram’s “Daily Grind” poem. Being a negotiating reader, I made the connection to my own life of how boring and painful routine is sometimes. I think almost everyone can relate to being frustrated and bored with the same routine time after time. I was reading the poem, agreeing that yes, routine is boring but I also just drifted off thinking about how boring and how much my life is lived through routine. 

I found “Sestina” to be one the more enjoyable poems to read, maybe because it just intrigued me and the meaning was obvious but it also had deeper meaning behind it. Reading this I was a negotiating reader I think, just because even though everyone probably understood the basic idea of what the theme was I still tried to gather as much as my own opinions from the text that suited what I wanted the poem to mean. The grandmother and the child are left alone, the tears suggest an obvious tragedy in both their lives. They symbolize the realness of someone mourning over death. Although both the child and grandmother are alone they are together and still have a house filled with love. That’s at least what I wanted to gather from the poem.

With E.E. Cummings poems I read them as the dominant reader. Specifically for the “r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r” it’s clear that the poem is about a grasshopper but it was difficult to understand what was being said or symbolized by the grasshopper. Although for [1(a)] reading as a dominant reader I understood it was about loneliness but extracting words and phrases (“oneliness” and “a leaf falls”). To me a when a leaf falls it falls alone, suggesting loneliness. But the word “oneliness” (even though it may not be a real word, ONE is in lONEliness) to me represents being whole with yourself. Even if your alone it doesn’t necessarily mean your alone.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[You might ask yourself WHY you were trying to "decipher any hidden meanings or themes"? What were your expectations for the code poems and HOW did that effect how you approached the poems?

From where I sit, your reading was tainted from the get go because you expecting something from them that might not have been there or you were looking for hidden things--which means you were decoding the poems in a specific way. Ask yourself why you felt compelled to do that--because this is a lit class and there must be hidden meanings in the assigned reading? THERE MUST BE!?!?!? Or, you don't understand code and therefore thought that there must be something mysterious in the poems? Or, you expected something that wasn't there? 

Try to free up your expectations, or at least account for them. Ask yourself how you are approaching a text and what biases you bring to the table when you approach them -- how then do you account for those biases? How do they influence how you approach the text and what you expect to get out of them?]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Yup. You might also think about how those tears are attached to other items in the poem other than the grandmother and the overall mood that creates. Who is doing all this crying anyway? And what does that mean to the act of mourning? What's being mourned exactly? How much do we know about what affects the lives of others? How does the poem mimic that lack of insight, but acknowledge that we often know something is up...]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Great readings Nicole. You could flesh a few of these out and figure out what the criteria for what's here--in other words, how is your reading here, if we push it, suggesting that the poems have a particular perspective on being alone, for instance? How might you characterize that based on what's in the poems and your expectations and finally how you negotiate the terms in the poems through your own lens.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The first time that I read “r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r” I made the assumption right away that the poem was all gibberish and that it was annoying. This shows that I read this in a very negotiated way. I understood that the text was about a grasshopper but when I read the mixed up words, I immediately read what I wanted to read. By re-reading the text in a more dominant way, I found more clues of the theme. The poem is still quite confusing but I was able to decipher words and phrases such as become, rearrange, gathering into, as we look, and obviously grasshopper. While I’m still struggling with finding a theme in these words, by reading the poem in a different manner, I was able to make more sense of it.
	The theme that I came up with the first time that I read “Agrippa” was memories. It was difficult for me to find a more specific theme is this poem because the sections didn’t seem to have a lot of close similarities to them. When I reread this poem, I tried to do it as an oppositional reader. By doing this I discovered that I could find a multitude of different meanings in the text as long as I had evidence to prove it. From one perspective I read the poem as the acceptance of war and guns in our modern age and how society got to that point. The poem romanticized guns by saying that it was “like the first time you put your mouth on a woman.” In that time, it was also very common for men to be fighting the war, which encourages violent behavior. I might be just pulling ideas out of nothing but I’m just trying to find other potential meanings out of the text.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Initially the way I was reading the poem “Agrippa” was in a dominant way as I understood the basic idea of the poem. I understood that the poem involved nostalgia when he was going through individual memories and reminiscing through the Kodak photos. Nostalgia, war and death were still the most prominent themes to me. Since I gathered the main themes at the end of the poem without questioning the implications further or making more of an effort to further explore the poem or what else it could represent, it would be classified as dominant reading. 
When I read through the code poems, I was getting frustrated because I couldn’t get past the dominant way of reading. Since they were foreign to me, I couldn’t apply them to what I already know or have them influence the way my thoughts. This meant I wasn’t reading in a negotiating or oppositional way.
Going back and re reading the poems was easier because after viewing how others interpreted or read the poems gave me clues to better understand what the themes are and what the author is trying to get across. I attempted to change the way I read “Sestina” from dominant to negotiating and even though it took some effort I feel I was able to get past the most basic meaning and into how my interests aim to change what I take from it. For instance to me the basic idea of the poem is that an elderly woman is obviously troubled by something- the tears and the keeping herself busy in the kitchen so the child doesn’t see are cues that she is upset. The almanac it seems has said something that causes her distress or foreshadows something terrible is about to happen or has happened already. Overall the main idea I take from “Sestina” is that a tragedy has occurred and the grandmother and child are coping with it in their own way. To read it in a negotiating way I took this idea further and thought of how the gloomy setting and dismal behaviours described could be something to do with their mental states. Since I am a psychology major I tend to relate everything to this field because it interests me. After reading the poem again in this new way I thought it could be possible that the poem could represent mental health. It’s possible that the grandmother is depressed and that she feels worse at different times of the year based on her ‘equinoctial tears’ which refer to the equinox which happens twice a year. Some people deal with seasonal depression and are only depressed at certain times of the year so it could be possible. Anyways this poem probably isn’t about that but I applied it to my interests and this is what I could come up with that made sense.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[After rereading “Agrippa” I can say that I was a dominant reader. The text of the poem predominantly consisted of stanzas about pictures in a black book. These pictures which I believe were meant to bring up memories for the author also created certain visualization from me. I also agree that the my personal experiences may change the way I perceive a photo and even literature. Reading “Sestina’ the first time as a dominant reader I thought the theme was  personification of objects but after rereading the poem I felt as if I fit in the negotiating reader.  I read “Sestina” right after “Agrippa” which may have affected my perspective of the “Sestina” poem because I believe the poem is now about memory. Reading certain stanzas that mention tears and the picture a child draws makes me believe the poem is about a sad memory. 
I was also dominant as I read “r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r” again. “r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r”  is about a grasshopper as it is throughout the poem numerous times. But I felt I was also a negotiated reader because rereading the poem brought up thoughts about codes in The Bug and how the theme could be about perceiving visualizations differently. Overall I found this module difficult because I am not really into poems and had a tough time trying to figure out the themes. (Especially the “code poems”)]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[These past couple modules have been quite the struggle for me. I have always struggled with understanding poetry, on top of that deciphering what the poems mean. I find that when reading a poem that I struggle to understand, I tend to be a dominant reader and take the poetry for its literal meaning. 

When I was reading “Sestina” I was similar to almost everyone else who read the poem. To start, I began to read the poem as a dominant reader. The setting was described at the beginning of the poem, which can be taken literally. There is nothing that I have relate necessarily to my own life in the setting, but just take the description that the author is giving me. The poem goes on to talk about an older lady and frequently personifies different inanimate objects which would be strange to read as a dominant reader. I then began to read the poem in a different perspective of a negotiating reader.

I found that reading through this I am a dominant and a negotiating reader as I start to read every poem in a literal manner, however, the moment that the literal meaning of the poem begins to sound crazy, I turn my perspective to a negotiating reader. When I read I look to see which outcome of the poem makes the most sense.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[“[l(a]” at first sight is uniquely written like page source made to confuse. It was not the usual poem I have encountered before; its meaning foreign if I was not attentive to what is hidden between each line. In “[l(a]”, I first understood it as a falling leaf, leaving its home one by one. Interestingly the author crafted the poem to a falling leaf, five sets of two letters each having lines, then lastly an “l” by itself, in its own line. The poem signifies that of loneliness, being separated as expressed on the last line. My initial analysis thus, shows dominant reading. As opposed to what the poem shows from its appearance, I think that the poem can also mean being one with something else, one with a different crowd rather than being alone. As evidenced by the word “oneliness”, it could also be pulled out from the word loneliness, which means being compact or strength in who you are as an individual. I can compare this to a high school graduate moving on to further her knowledge, moving on from where it planted its roots, for it to become stronger, to become a newer tree; a better person.  I also think that loneliness might not be pertaining to the leaf, but instead to the tree. Moreover, it may describe a tree that becomes lonely during winter time, alone without the leaves that keep it warm.  I can’t even explain how insightful this poem was written, reading this brought me from reading by the surface: dominant reading, then relating it to myself: negotiated reading, and lastly oppositional.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[When I reread “Agrippa”, I was (as many other people) a dominant reader because my first thought was the poem is about “memory” and many of my peers agreed. I have the same experience as Maxine when she said she tried to read it in a different perspective. The years, flashbacks, objects that represents the past makes the theme of the poem obvious so literal meaning stands out. I feel like there is no “hidden” meaning behind the poem, at least in my experience. Maybe because I could not relate to the poem, so I could not be a negotiated reader. 
When I read Sestina for the first time, I was a dominant reader because the word “tears” shows up most of the time. So I was just reading the poem (not really thinking about it) and understanding just the text. For the second time, I noticed the word “almanac” and I looked it up, it means calendar. Since the grandmother sad and depressed, she is probably worried about aging and time passing too quickly. For example, “time to plant tears, says the almanac” and the word September at the beginning. I guess this makes me a negotiating reader since I agree what my peers said about the grandmother being sad but sad for different reason. 

For the other poems such as “ “r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r”, I think I was an oppositional reader because I interpreted the text a lot differently from my peers. I knew the word grasshopper at the end but I didn’t know the grasshopper was part of the title and the theme until David mentioned this. I thought the poem was about codes because that is our theme for the course. When I read it for the second time, I finally got the message: the second last sentence re arranging become grasshopper. The author is trying to “annoy” us that the poem is about something simple (a grasshopper) and grasshopper can be annoying.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[After reading the first poem Agrippa again I see that my initial view on the theme of it was very dominant. I touched the surface on how it was based on memories. Seeing each stanza was based with a year I focused too much on the fact rather than on the detail behind it. This is too broad and does not tell us the true meaning the author is trying to present through the poem. 

The themes of sorrow and sadness I got from Sestina because of the use of words such as “tears” and “rain” was more of a negotiating style of reading for me. I interpreted the ideas of sadness and sorrow from those words and looking in detail in the story of those words meanings.  Also with the first line starting with September I use a negotiating style of connecting it to my own interpretation into how September is usually a very stressful month for me with school starting.

I tried reading Sestina in a oppositional way of how the grandmothers story was happy and cheerful. Doing this gave me a different perspective of the story and gave me some a new perspective of the meaning the author is trying to say behind the story. I saw the close connection between the grandmother and the child and that they are suffering from a loss or tragedy. The story is very sad but the connection and love they have is wonderful.

With both the coded poems and r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r and 1(a my interpretation of the themes very all very dominant. I only looked at the surface of the codes and the patterns that made and the unscrambled letters but not the meaning behind them. I see the poem says grasshopper for example but what is the author intending by it. I hope I can improve my interpretation skills behind these poems so I can see the authors true intention behind these poems.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[For “Agrippa” my reading was similar to most of the comments as my perspective of the poem was through dominant reading. I had read it to understand the generic theme about memories present throughout the entire poem. I did not look for a deeper meaning or another idea for the poem nor did I reject any other ideas present in the poem.
My reading was also dominant for “TWOFACED” as I just read the main concept of being two faced in our everyday language. However, if you think with a negotiating perspective, then being two faced doesn’t so seem bad. The poem makes it obvious that most people do it and how it may be a bad thing, but when I think of it realistically it would be impossible to not be two faced. In some situations it would be worse to be brutally honest to people than to just lie because sometimes I prefer to just lie to people and agree with them if I know that I will not see them in a while. So maybe from my point of view it could also be an oppositional reading method.
The only negotiated reading I did from all the poems was “ Sestina” because the dominant reading made the theme related to grief. However, my negotiated reading is what decided that the grief was related to the lost of a loved one, who may be the grandfather of the novel. I predicted it was a grandfather due to the grandma’s random crying and the child’s drawing of the man. I also guessed that maybe the weather or season was related to being around the time of the grandfather was deceased.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[After going through the poems again and re-reading my discussions of them, I think that I am a mix of a dominant and a negotiating reader. For example, when I read “Agrippa”, I did very little to extrapolate the deeper details and meanings of the poem. I noticed that I was only pointing out the obvious themes and concepts. A dominant reader only sees the text for what was intended and what other people would also assume was intended. With “Sestina”, I used the same process. The information that I collected was basic and easy to find. 

However, for some of the other poems, instead of seeing them for what the author might be trying to portray, I connected the situations to my own life and own experiences. For example, my older brother had taken several computing science courses and is quite well versed. When I showed him the poems, he noticed the different kinds of languages right away (Java, C++, etc.). Once I realized that the poems were more complicated that I thought and not what I had expected, I began to assume that I wouldn’t be able to decipher them without understanding the code. I noticed the main themes in each poem, like the dominant reader, but I rejected some of the more complicated verses knowing that I probably wouldn’t be able to understand them. This shows that I was a negotiating reader because I was caught between discovering the author’s intentions for the poems while knowing that there are much deeper meanings- supposedly beyond my reach.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[After rereading "r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r and 1(a " I was able to grasp the utmost basic understanding a for person who does not possess high and precise analytically skills with poetry. The contents when unscrambled were just the surface, who knows if the author is trying to convey a deeper message (I would like to learn how to analyze these types of code poems for future benefit). For example "r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r" unscrambled may be "grasshopper" but I, for one, is unsure of what the author E.E Cummings is trying to convey. I would also like to state that I was a dominate reader with "Agrippa" because it was very straight forward as I was able to skim the surface or encryption and memories with physical belonging such as photographs.

Almost everything I learn is hard to grasp unless I incorporate content to my own interest, I am careful of not being bias to try and understand what the author is projecting. I took the reading of "Two-faced" into a negotiated approach to understand the short poem. It is probably safe to assume everyone experiences or at least seen the petty dramas that comes along with high school. It wasn't long before I associated the content of the poem to catty, jealous and insecure girls back in the days to suit my own interest. The words in the poem rang, as it is very immature to use that kind of vulgarity behind someone's back.
As I reread the depressing poem "Sestina" I couldn't help but to have negotiating as well as opposing views towards it, as my own grandmother was a happy and positive being before she passed. The grandmother in the poem was clearly unhappy and the reasons were unclear, being so, it led to a lot of possibilities and room for inference. In society and on television I've seen, the elderly are often portrayed as bitter and sad whereas I've seen some happy and enjoyable elderly people. 

Hope this comment isn't too late! I hope you can accept this. Thank you]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[As I read the poem “Agrippa”, I was trying to read it like a dominant reader. I reread every line, trying to imagine the imagery exactly how the author intended. As the author saw each picture, he also encoded the pictures with a very detailed description. While describing the old photos, Gibson used other senses like smell and touch; rather than just site. An example of this would be when Gibson describes the smell of the “pitch” as “the sweet hot reek”.  Memory is a theme that stood out to me in this poem because with every picture, Gibson gave an extremely detailed description, as if he was the one taking the photos. These photographs are the memories of his life. These are relatives and friends that have passed on. I’m assuming they’re now diseased because it is called “the book of the dead”. I wasn’t quite clear what Gibson meant by “the mechanism”, this is when I started to think like a negotiating reader. The mechanism might be a symbol for what is now losst or forgotten. The people in the photos might be dead but the memory of them still remains in the narrators mind. 
	The “r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r” poem was much more intriguing to me because I admired the way it was laid out. It looked confusing at first, like a code. There were random letters, brackets and the lines but once I took a closer look at the poem, it started to make a little more sense to me. Perhaps I’m reading the poem like an oppositional reader, but the theme in this poem was like a grasshopper. The way the letters jump around and change places are just like how grasshoppers do. Also, the only word the in the poem was the word grasshopper but rearranged differently in every line. My favorite line in the poem was “rea(be)rran(com)gi(e)ngly” because it spells become and rearranging, and if you rearrange the words they spell grasshopper.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I feel a bit out of this world when reading “Agrippa”… because I feel the author’s intentions are to pass on memories to the reader, just as the speaker carries memories from reading the “black book” (Gibson, William “Agrippa”). I feel like a dominated reader when I think the theme is memories, and passing them is the closest you can get to immortality, just like penumbra’s bookstore.  However, “r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r” can be interpreted differently for every person due to its abnormal format as a poem because everyone can reference different meanings. For instance, I do see grasshopper a couple of times in the poem, but I also see that grasshopper is a reference to “The karate kid”, one who is new and willing to learn. With this, I feel the author’s intentions to say that, at the time of when the poem was published, we are new to computers, and need to learn how computers work, and we will encounter problems here and there just like in The Bug; problems such as encoding and decoding codes, such as the poem itself. Furthermore, I conclude that the theme for “r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r” is learning. But someone can interpret it as a bug, which eats crops and is a nuisance to society. “Sestina” can be interpreted as a sad poem, due to its symbolism. The adjectives such as “dark”, “failing”, chilly all make the poem feel dark. The grandmother is alone with the child while “hiding her tears”, giving the reader ideas of unfortunate events such as the grandfather dying, giving the poem a depressing tone.  One can assume the theme is loneliness, because there is only the grandmother, and child in a house surrounded by rain, making it sound dark. However, one can interpret the theme as depression if they use an oppositional reading by assuming the child has down syndrome. The child draws “inscrutable house[es]”, giving the idea that the child has certain limitations from drawing a square and a triangle. Overall, I think you’ll interpret different themes based on what kind of reader you are.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Instructions:</strong> <em>Due for Feb. 25th class.</em> If you've read <em>Moxyland</em>, you know that the story is told from four different perspectives (Kendra, Lerato, Tendeka, Toby). This module asks you to think about perspectives by engaging with definitions--a really important way of dealing with themes. To complete this module, you will need to go to the library. 

<strong>Task: </strong>Below is a list of themes (well, there's really just terms, words, concepts). What I want you to do is come up with four <em>different</em> definitions for one of the terms listed below. There's a few restrictions: 1) you can use only one on-line search (so, Google OR Wikipedia, but not both and then it's off with the internets); 2) two of your definitions must be from a dictionary (a paper-based one) and an encyclopedia (a paper-based one); 3) one of your definitions must come from a human being. Then, write out your definitions in the comment space below. Try to vary the term you choose, we don't need 35 entries on dystopia.

What do I mean by different definitions, exactly? The goal of this module is to get you thinking about how a term can be defined differently by different perspectives. The reason I want paper-based sources isn't because I hate the internet, but because an encyclopedia and dictionary are likely to be out-of-date and thus offer a different angle than Google or Wikipedia, which are both updated constantly (maybe). Finally, the human being will often offer something vague or discursive (look up that word in the dictionary!). If it turns out that all the definitions you assemble for the module are identical, well then so be it; but I doubt this will happen. Make sure you identify the source (dictionary name and date of publication, encyclopedia name and date of publication, my mother, Google, etc.)

Here's an example of what you should produce (but with a lame term):

<strong>Cat:</strong>

<ul>
	
<li>Google:</li>
	<blockquote><li>noun 1. a small domesticated carnivorous mammal with soft fur, a short snout, and retractile claws. It is widely kept as a pet or for catching mice, and many breeds have been developed. synonyms: feline, tomcat, tom, kitten, mouser; More a wild animal of the cat family. "a marbled cat" used in names of catlike animals of other families, e.g., ring-tailed cat. historical short for cat-o'-nine-tails. short for catfish. short for cathead. short for catboat. 2. NORTH AMERICAN informal (particularly among jazz enthusiasts) a person, especially a man. verb NAUTICAL verb: cat; 3rd person present: cats; past tense: catted; past participle: catted; gerund or present participle: catting 1.raise (an anchor) from the surface of the water to the cathead.</li></blockquote>

	<li>Dictionary (Merriam-Webster, 1967):</li>
<blockquote><li>a small animal that is related to lions and tigers and that is often kept by people as a pet; a lion, tiger, leopard, or similar wild animal; a man</li></blockquote>

<li>My Friend Jane:</li><blockquote><li> So cute! Cutest thing in the world! LOL cat!</li></blockquote>

<li>Encyclopedia Brittanica:</li><blockquote><li>Domestic cat (Felis catus), also called house cat,  domesticated member of the family Felidae, order Carnivora, and the smallest member of that family. Like all felids, domestic cats are characterized by supple, low-slung bodies, finely molded heads, long tails that aid in balance, and specialized teeth and claws that adapt them admirably to a life of active hunting. Domestic cats possess other features of their wild relatives in being basically carnivorous, remarkably agile and powerful, and finely coordinated in movement.</li></blockquote>
</ul>

<strong>Summary:</strong>

Notice how each one of the definitions is slightly different? That's what we're going for because it allows us to think about themes in a way that narrows our focus and gives us a clear picture of how diverse the conversation about that theme is already. And just so you know, we would never quote any of the definitions we find in an essay--this is a way into writing and thinking, not part of the main event.

Here's the list of themes:

biotechnology, dystopia, utopia, nanotechnology, digital technology, hierarchy, hegemony, privilege, tension, race, cyberpunk, indulgence, totalitarianism, government, gender, corporation, consent, ecology, signal, control, autonomy.

*Remember, only pick one of the terms and define it four ways as directed above. Have fun!]]></content:encoded>

Dictionary (New Websters, 1992):

"Any ideal state, constitution, system or way of life"

My coworker Brent:

"An ideal living arrangement, where everyone is happy"

Wikipedia

"A utopia is a community or society possessing highly desirable or near perfect qualities. The word was coined by Sir Thomas More in Greek for his 1516 book Utopia (in Latin), describing a fictional island society in the Atlantic Ocean. The term has been used to describe both intentional communities that attempt to create an ideal society, and imagined societies portrayed in fiction. It has spawned other concepts, most prominently dystopia."

“Noun 1. An imaginary or hypothetical place or state of things considered to be perfect; a condition of social or political perfection."]]></wp:comment_content>

Wikipedia: 
"Gender is the range of characteristics pertaining to, and differentiating between, masculinity and femininity. Depending on the context, these characteristics may include biological sex (i.e. the state of being male, female or intersex), sex-based social structures (including gender roles and other social roles), or gender identity."

Dictionary (Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd ed. 2011):
Noun
1) In some (esp. Indo-European) languages, as Latin, French, German, English, etc.: each of the classes (typically masculine, feminine, neuter, common) of nouns and pronouns distinguished by the different inflections which they have and which they require in words syntactically associated with them; similarly applied to adjectives (and in some languages) verbs, to denote the appropriate form for accompanying a noun of such a class. Also: the fact, condition, or property of belonging to such a class; the classification of language in this way.

My brother Steven:
Someone who has a female or male identity, regardless of what they were born with.

Encyclopedia Britannica (2013):
"an individual’s self-conception as being male or female, as distinguished from actual biological sex. For most persons, gender identity and biological characteristics are the same. "]]></wp:comment_content>

"Totalitarianism is a political system in which the state holds total authority over the society and seeks to control all aspects of public and private life wherever possible."

My friend Matt: 

"Government owned state,  along with total ownership of property, businesses, assets. Strict rules, often are absolute. Unusually large amount of GDP goes to military spending. Less freedom of speech, alienation of rights are often common-side with totalitarianism. State controlled media, as masses need to be swayed to follow total rule. Also has the characteristic of 'removing' political opponents and 'noisy' minorities. Afraid of internet, and social media, as they are unable to be controlled by state (Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram). 

Examples include : Soviet Union, North Korea"

Wikipedia: 

Consent is agreement or permission to do or allow something. 

My friend, Elise: 

When you are allowed or given permission to do something. 

Dictionary (Webster's Dictionary and Thesaurus 2007):

To agree, to give one's permission (to consent the operation). Agreement, permission. 

Encyclopedia (Encyclopedia Britannica):

Consent, in ethics and political philosophy, an act of permitting something to be done or of recognizing some authority. Granting consent implies relinquishing some authority in a sphere of concern in which one’s sovereignty ought otherwise to be respected. Consent is, under certain conditions, generally taken to have deep moral significance, but scholars disagree over what forms of consent generate what sorts of obligations and what conditions make consent morally and legally significant.]]></wp:comment_content>

Gender is the range of characteristics pertaining to, and differentiating between, masculinity and femininity.

Gender is what describes males and females.
Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology, 1966:
Gender is any of the three ‘kinds’, masculine, feminine and neuter, of nouns, adjectives, and pronouns; kind, sort.

"'Gender' refers to the socially constructed roles, behaviours, activities, and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women."

Dictionary (Grolier New Websters Dictionary, 1992)
"the classification of words, or the class to which a word belongs by virtue of such classification, according to the sex of the referent (natural gender) or according to arbitrary distinctions to form a syntax (grammatical gender)|| (pop) sex (male or female).

"Gender is the way that people express their sexual identity."—Gel

Encyclopedia Britannica
"in language, a phenomenon in which the words of a certain part of speech, usually nouns require the agreement, or concord, through grammatical marking (or infection), if various other words related to them in a sentence. In languages that exhibit gender, two or more classes of nouns control variation in words of other parts of speech (typically pronouns and adjectives, and sometimes verbs). These other words maintain constant meaning but vary in form according to the class of the words that controls hem in a given situation."]]></wp:comment_content>

•	Wikipedia:
 A dystopia (from the Greek δυσ- and τόπος, alternatively, cacotopia,[1] kakotopia, or anti-utopia) is an imaginary community or society that is undesirable or frightening.[2][3] It is literally translated as "not-good place", an antonym of utopia. Such societies appear in many artistic works, particularly in stories set in a future. Dystopias are often characterized by dehumanization,[2] totalitarian governments, environmental disaster,[3] or other characteristics associated with a cataclysmic decline in society. Dystopian societies appear in many sub-genres of fiction and are often used to draw attention to real-world issues regarding society, environment, politics, economics, religion, psychology, ethics, science, and/or technology, which if unaddressed could potentially lead to such a dystopia-like condition.


•	Dictionary  (English Dictionary -1994 )
                 An imaginary place where everything which is as bad as is it can be. 
•	Librarian from Douglas college  :
                  Its opposite of Utopia please or community highly desirable.
                (I asked more than 12 random people no one of them knows the meaning of dystopia).
•	Encyclopedia : ( New dictionary of the history of ideas, 1974)  
Dystopia is utopia’s polarized mirror image.

1. Wikipedia 

“In the teaching of the Catholic Church, an indulgence is "a remission before God of the temporal punishment due to sins whose guilt has already been forgiven, which the faithful Christian who is duly disposed gains under certain prescribed conditions through the action of the Church which, as the minister of redemption, dispenses and applies with authority the treasury of the satisfactions of Christ and the saints"

Indulgences allow for the remission of the severe penances of the early Church, which was granted at the intercession of Christians awaiting martyrdom, or at least imprisoned for the faith. They draw on the Treasury of Merit accumulated by Christ's superabundantly meritorious sacrifice on the cross and the virtues and penances of the saints. They are granted for specific good works and prayers in proportion to the devotion with which those good works are performed or prayers recited.”

2. My Friend Jenny

“The act of exciting ones senses for purely selfish results.”

3. Dictionary: A supplement to the Oxford English Dictionary Volume 2: 1976

“(Without preposition.) To gratify a desire, appetite, etc; to take ones pleasure; to ‘partake’, i.e. (too) freely of intoxicants. (pg. 292)”

4. Encyclopedia: Britannica 

“Bohemian religious controversy.”

   Encyclopedia: New Catholic Encyclopedia

“Authoritative grants from the Church’s treasury for the remission or payment in whole (plenary indulgences) or in part (partial indulgences), valid before God, of the debt of temporal punishment after the guilt of sin has been forgiven. This definition of the Code presumes that sin must be first forgiven before the indulgence can be gained.]]></wp:comment_content>

Wikipedia :
Cyberpunk is a subgenre of science fiction in a future setting, noted for its focus on "high tech and low life".[1][2] It features advanced science, such as information technology and cybernetics, coupled with a degree of breakdown or radical change in the social order.[3]

My Friend Erika:
"cyberpunk is like... an alternative fashion style.. I describe it as space themed clothing. for literature.. spacey post apocalyptic scenarios?"

(going to be at the college shortly, so I will find the paper based definitions and post those in a reply)]]></wp:comment_content>

"Totalitarianism was the term employed by the Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini (1883-1945) who took power in 1922, to describe the new type of regime he hoped to, and by 1927 partially did, establish in Italy. Although Mussolini did not invent the term, he brought it into common usage, and generations of political leaders, intellectuals, and scholars have continued to employ it, not in the positive sense Mussolini intended, but as a description of a political system fundamentally at odds with basic human values." (188) 

The encyclopedia then uses the analysis of Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski who in their "Totalitiarian Dictatorship and autocracy (1956)" to define the characteristics of totalitarianism. These include:

1)An official and all embracing ideology

2) A one party system

3)the imposition of terror

4) Mass mobilization of the population. 

5) A lack of genuine pluralism

6) A monopoly on the armed forces/law

Dictionary: Random House Webster's College Dictionary (1991)

"adj. 1. noting or pertaining to a centralized government that does not tolerate parties or differing opinion and that exercises dictorial control over many aspects of life. 2. exercising control over freedom, will, or thought of others, authoritarian; autocratic. -n. 3. an adherent of totalitarian principles or government]]></wp:comment_content>

o	“("nanotech") is the manipulation of matter on an atomic, molecular, and supramolecular scale.”

•	Dictionary ( Canadian Oxford Dictionary 2ed, 2004):

o	“Noun, the branch of technology that deals with dimensions and tolerances of less than 100 nanometres, esp. the manipulation of individual atoms and molecules.”

•	Encyclopedia Brittanica:

o	“The manipulation and manufacture of materials and devices on the scale of atoms or small groups of atoms. The “nanoscale” is typically measured in nanometres, or billionths of a metre (nanos, the Greek word for “dwarf,” being the source of the prefix), and materials built at this scale often exhibit distinctive physical and chemical properties due to quantum mechanical effects. Although usable devices this small may be decades away (see microelectromechanical system), techniques for working at the nanoscale have become essential to electronic engineering, and nanoengineered materials have begun to appear in consumer products. For example, billions of microscopic “nanowhiskers,” each about 10 nanometres in length, have been molecularly hooked onto natural and synthetic fibres to impart stain resistance to clothing and other fabrics; zinc oxide nanocrystals have been used to create invisible sunscreens that block ultraviolet light; and silver nanocrystals have been embedded in bandages to kill bacteria and prevent infection.”

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Government

WIKIPEDIA:  
A government is the system by which a state or community is governed.[1] In the Commonwealth of Nations, the word government is also used more narrowly to refer to the collective group of people that exercises executive authority in a state.[2][3][4] This usage is analogous to what is called an "administration" in American English. Furthermore, government is occasionally used in English as a synonym for governance.

In the case of its broad associative definition, government normally consists of legislators, administrators, and arbitrators. Government is the means by which state policy is enforced, as well as the mechanism for determining the policy of the state. A form of government, or form of state governance, refers to the set of political systems and institutions that make up the organisation of a specific government. 

DICTIONARY: 
Webster's third new International Dictionary Unabridged, 2002
1: The act of governing
2:The office, authority, or function of governing 

My 11 year old cousin, Jessica: 
Obama and power 

ENCYCLOPEDIA: 
The World book Encyclopedia, 2012 
Government is an institution that establishes and enforces rules, provides services, and manages other affairs for a group of people. The term may also refer to the process of ruling or excising power.]]></wp:comment_content>

Just reading your post I found it really interesting/kinda funny that we as humans and google define hierarchy as people, things, objects, values and so on. Whereas, old dictionaries and encyclopedias define hierarchy as people and people only.

I found that the encyclopedias defined a few of the themes religiously. Looking at it through a religious perspective I can now see how it's relevant to many different cultures.]]></wp:comment_content>

Roommate’s Mother (February, 2015):
Utopia – means paradise, heaven 
“Everyone has their own idea of utopia”

Wikipedia (February, 2015):
“A utopia (/juːˈtoʊpiə/ yoo-TOH-pee-ə) is a community or society possessing highly desirable or near perfect qualities. The word was coined by Sir Thomas More in Greek for his 1516 book Utopia (in Latin), describing a fictional island society in the Atlantic Ocean. The term has been used to describe both intentional communities that attempt to create an ideal society, and imagined societies portrayed in fiction. It has spawned other concepts, most prominently dystopia.”

Dictionary (New Websters, 1992):
“Any ideal state, constitution, system or way of life”

The Universal Standard Encyclopedia (1956):
“Name given by Sir Thomas More to the imaginary island which he makes the scene of his famous political romance of that name. More’s satire, for the “island” is England, obtained a wide popularity, and supplied the epithet Utopian to all impracticable schemes for the improvement of society.”]]></wp:comment_content>

“Gender is a social construct to which society has greatly based the categories of people as being either male or female and has ignored the aspect of individual preference and identity.”


Shorter Oxford English Dictionary. (2002). Oxford University Press Inc, New York, United States. Volume 1 A-M. Fifth Edition. p.1081:
“1.Kind, sort, class, genus.
2. Any of the classes (masculine, feminine, neuter, common) of nouns and pronouns distinguished by modification which they require in words syntactically associated with them and roughly corresponding to the sex or sexlessness of the objects which they denote; the property if belonging to such a class; the appropriate form for accompanying a noun of one such as class; the classification of nouns and other words in this way, as a grammatical principle. 
3. State of being male, female, or neuter; sex; the members of one or other sex.”

The World Book Encyclopedia (2011). G Volume 8 A Scott Fetzer Company. Chicago. p.80:

A hierarchy (sometimes abbreviated HR) can link entities either directly or indirectly, and either vertically or horizontally. The only direct links in a hierarchy, insofar as they are hierarchical, are to one's immediate superior or to one of one's subordinates, although a system that is largely hierarchical can also incorporate alternative hierarchies. Indirect hierarchical links can extend "vertically" upwards or downwards via multiple links in the same direction, following a path. All parts of the hierarchy which are not linked vertically to one another nevertheless can be "horizontally" linked through a path by traveling up the hierarchy to find a common direct or indirect superior, and then down again.”

Dictionary (Webster’s Third New International Dictionary, 2005):
“A form of government administered by an authoritarian group” 

My friend Ruksar:
“A triangle showing levels of stuff with the importance  level of each thing getting higher and higher”

Encyclopedia Britannica:
Hiearchy (Greek hierarchia; from hieros, sacred + archein, rule) is a kind of order, supposing existence of higher (or more sacred) and lower (less sacred) levels of reality. Order, in its turn, is a linkage of fundamentally different elements by means of general law, so that the whole is greater than a simple arithmetical sum of its parts. Since order presupposes difference, it often takes the form of hiearchy. The place of an element in the hierarchical order is determined by the same laws of the while, which are constitutive of the order itself.”]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Wikipedia
A utopia (/juːˈtoʊpiə/ yoo-TOH-pee-ə) is a community or society possessing highly desirable or near perfect qualities. The word was coined by Sir Thomas More in Greek for his 1516 book Utopia (in Latin), describing a fictional island society in the Atlantic Ocean. The term has been used to describe both intentional communities that attempt to create an ideal society, and imagined societies portrayed in fiction. It has spawned other concepts, most prominently dystopia.

Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary (1913 + 1828)
1. An imaginary island, represented by Sir Thomas More, in a work called Utopia, as enjoying the greatest perfection in politics, laws, and the like. 
2. Hence, any place or state of ideal perfection.
‘Ideal setting, basically a “perfect world” ‘–my friend

Stealing this from Brian Metzak, because I don’t have access to an encyclopedia right now.
Encyclopedic Dictionary of English Usage (Prentice Hall, 2nd edition,1993): (from Greek./ “no place;” title of 1516 book by Thomas More. Perfect society
I’m gonna give my definition because I feel my own contribution would be: A sandy hill with wind flowing with a couple of hay balls rolling—a world that does not have any people. I feel utopia cannot exist because people have too many DIFFERENT definitions of a “perfect world” which causes conflict with one’s ideal utopia with another, which is why I think we cannot create a “perfect world” with us altogether. 

Anyways, I’d assume the takeaways are: we see things in different views, as it is the reason behind why we see or do things for what they are. Like how someone sees communism as the more efficient system in the world, drugs to someone can be a taboo compared to a regular drug user, or even why Toby is so narcissistic in finding interesting stories for his stream.]]></wp:comment_content>

He's going to school, getting good grades, drinking beer here and there, and eating a lot. He said he's 'happy where [he] is right now. But how long would his happiness last? Who knows?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Instructions:</strong> <em>Due for the March 4th class.</em> This module is about defining things so that you can come up with thematic approaches to texts. It's pretty straightforward: think about differences and expectations. 
</p>

<strong>Summary:</strong>

<strong>Task:</strong> Write a list in the comment area below of the five (5) most significant differences between you and your parents' generation. YOU CANNOT REPEAT SOMETHING SOMEONE IN THE CLASS HAS ALREADY WRITTEN IN THE COMMENT SPACE. YOU MUST COME UP WITH AN ORIGINAL LIST; NO REPEATS.  

<p><strong>Outcomes:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Think about the question in a variety of ways, not just technological--how do you eat, or cook, differently for instance?</li>
<li>Try not to limit things to differences that suggest positives or negatives--think about things that are just different. Where there isn't necessarily a value judgement associated with the difference.</li>
<li>Try to think about different contexts -- social differences, cultural differences, economic differences. </li>
<li>Frame things around attitudes not just visual cues. Sure, cars look sleeker, but are they uglier as a result? What is the difference between your parent's attitude toward government and your attitude?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your perspective informs how you notice differences.</li>
<li>Your expectations are often governed by how you want to be different than what's come before.</li>
<li>We often understand things by interpreting how we are different from those things.</li>
<li>We must always interpret the meaning behind what we see as different. Difference isn't an obvious condition.</li> 
</ul>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[1)	Dating: My parents have a different perspective when it comes to dating. Because they grew up in a strict background (Asian culture), dating was not allowed until eighteen/when they move out. They focus on finding the true love and getting married right after. On the other hand, my generation focused on dating like getting to know the person, getting involved with relationships and less thoughts about marriage. 
2)	Money and being cheap: At my parent’s time while growing up, I remember them telling me that they only get paid around four dollars an hour and I think that is why they are more careful about how much they spent. Also, my parents grew up poor (lack of food because Vietnamese War) so they were taught to save as much as they could. Contrary, I was more privilege than them so I did not have to worry about saving because even I did not earn as much, I still make enough to feed myself. 
3)	Being more greedier: I agree on nicolefrketich because I’ve noticed that me and my siblings are more greedier than my parents. We want new toys, iPads (because everyone has one, so we want it to “fit” in) and more competitive (like at school or getting into a program). Before that, when my parents are young, they are happy with what they got, which is a few toys because that is all they can afford. I guess as we are more privilege than the previous generation, we “want” more stuff. 
4)	Young people are more impatient: I’ve noticed that when it comes to waiting in line, I am more aggressive than my parents. I think that technology encourage us to be more speedy because technology is fast, you see results instantly and technology is always improving (more quicker now). My parents could wait the load screen on Wi-Fi but I’ve “struggled” a bit while waiting for the screen to load.
5)	Parents had to be independent at a young age: My parents had to work ten times harder than we did because they came from a poor country. Not only that, they have to be more independent by moving out from their parents sooner, getting their own car, buying their own house, learning handyman skills or cooking skills. In contrast, I am almost 20 and I still live with my parents (rent is ridiculous), still going to school and having my mom (still) cook for me and borrow their car. I guess that in our generation, we have an extended adolescent life because we go to school longer, marry later and longer lifespan.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey Jonathan!

I really enjoyed reading your comments on the differences in generations. My family is Ukrainian and my it's more so my dads side of the family who still carries on some of the traditions. My dad and his siblings always used to do Ukrainian dances in clubs, and go to church and so on, and it never got passed down to our generations (my, my siblings, and cousins).

I agree with you and it goes for any type of culture, back then they were always dressed more conservatively but these days it's all about booty shorts and crop tops.

When you mention the difference between health the aspects of your parents generation and ours is really interesting. I don't know what it is with out generation wanting to be skinny or perfectly sculpted with muscles.. anyways, I find it pretty cool that when you did go to Hong Kong you didn't see any. Im jealous, I feel like we live in a generation where we are so concerned with how we look. 

It was refreshing to realize that although we come from different cultures and places, that the differences in generation are similar.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[1)	Getting married and starting a family aren’t major goals in our twenties now due to an increased focus on our post-secondary education and career paths compared to our parents’ generation. 
2)	There’s more acceptance of individuals who are not heterosexual and individuals who belong to different ethic races now compared to our parents’ generation.
3)	There’s an increased amount of focus on terrorism and terrorist attacks in the media coverage now compared to the media coverage during our parents’ generation. 
4)	Technology’s presence in everyday society in the forms of cell phones, iPads, GPS in cars etc. is much higher now than it was during our parents’ generation. 
5)	Online shopping is another occurrence that is more prominent now than it was during my parents’ generation when stores would be the only place to buy clothes, food, gifts etc. whereas now we have Amazon, eBay and a various of other websites for different clothing labels.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Being as my parents grew up in Hungary, there are many cultural differences. First thing I thought of was, food. My mom always makes traditional home cooked meals, all from scratch and never using recipes. Now many of us frequently eat out, make meals that are less time consuming, less traditional. 
Another, is technology of course. Cell phones, ipads, internet was never a thing. Face to face meetings were important, whereas now we are all glued to our social media outlets, communicating through a screen rather than in person. 
For my parents generation, women having children at 17-18 years old was a social norm. My generation views 18 as being too young, we are expected to finish college and begin to make a living before caring for children.
In Hungary, schooling was much different. They didn't have high schools or universities, schooling for them ended at the grade 8 level. Not only is it different here, but now in Hungary they have more schooling available to pursue careers. 
And lastly, their taste/style in music is very different. Mainly because they enjoy Hungarian artists, to which I wouldn't be able to put into words what kind of style that is. However, the content of what they listen to is different. While the popular artists and music of my generation is heavily dependent on sex, drugs, violence, their interests were very romanticized and had more of a mellow tone to things. Knowing that there is a vast majority of differences between the generations, it was rather difficult to think of them so hopefully I didn't totally butcher the task.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Amongst Western culture, there are so many differences in our generation and the generation of our parent’s (depends on culture, race, location, etc.):

I’ve noticed, especially with my parent’s views in particular, that our generation can be much more open-minded about appearance. For example, my parents frown upon differences and changes that people make on their bodies. Not that they dislike those with tattoos and piercings, but they definitely judge them and assume about them much more than our generation, even if it’s unconsciously. This, in my opinion, it because it was extremely rare for people to have tattoos and piercing’s when they were growing up, so it’s kind of a surprise today. My brothers and I, as oppose to this, couldn’t care less about the choices that other’s make about their body. Whatever makes you happy is what you should do. I actually envy those who have the courage to completely go “against” the generation that raised us and wear whatever they feel suits them. It’s an act of uniqueness. We have also grown up seeing many people with physical changes on their bodies, so it’s much easier to adapt to the changes and go along with it, unlike our parents. 

Another extreme change is today’s socially acceptable ways to act and appear. Back when my parents were kids, they had to dress very formally and speak to their parents in quite serious manners. My mom, for instance, wasn’t allowed to wear pants in her public school. Instead, all young women wore skirts. I think that the attitudes and ways that we’ve been raised have been much more casual and laid back. 

I’ve noticed that for our generation, our idea of the “American Dream” is completely different from the ones that our parents had or have. The ideal lifestyle of my parents and their generation has always been the marriage, kids, and 9-5 career. Now, however, our generation seems to be swaying away from that traditional idea and becoming much more casual. Couples in our generation live together and don’t get married or show any interest in having kids. This situation would have been a rarity in my parents’ generation. There had always been the stay at home mom, taking care of the children and the father as the breadwinner. This lifestyle has completely altered, showing that both people in a relationship must work in order to keep up with the economy. 

In addition, our generation has shown a great acceptance of different cultures, sexual orientations, and disabilities. My parents were not as exposed to people from different countries around the world, people of different sexual orientations, and those with disabilities. My brothers and I grew up with tons of people who were of different nationalities or homosexual. On the other hand, my parents went to school with all Caucasians and no openly gay students or students with disabilities. I’m not trying to say that they are intolerant of completely judgemental of people with these aspects, but they are definitely not as open and completely comfortable with them as our generation is. 

Concern for the environment is also a great difference in generations. The conclusion that Global Warming is occurring has introduced countless “green” organizations and the encouragement to recycle and conserve our resources. This was never an issue for my parents’ generation because they had no idea of it. We, however, have been taught of the problems that the world will face if we don’t take action for the environment. This has completely altered our outlook on the environment in comparison to that of our parents. Instead of the planet being simply something to use, it’s now a resource that we have to respect, protect, and maintain.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[When it comes to spending, my parents are way more thrifty than I am. I've noticed that their attitudes towards buying products is that if it's not a necessity, it's not worth buying. I assume that because my parents lived in a place where there weren't a lot of job opportunities, they learned be more thrifty. 

Even though my parents are caught up with technological forms of communication, ie: cellphones and facebook to be precise, their communication style still adheres to their generational way of communicating. I don't see my parents sending messages containing "LOL" or "OMG" and any abbreviated words. Also, they tend to be more optimistic and positive with their posts and messages. Often times, they use social media to communicate to friends and family members but not to rant or express anger like my generation does.

With the technological breakthrough in this day and age, the form of entertainment/hobby between my parents and I differ widely. In today's time, the main modes of entertainment comprises of video games, movies, social media, and other electronic gadgets. My parent's main entertainments were climbing trees, hanging out with friends physically (not virtually), playing board games, playing cards, etc. 

One thing that really amazes me about my parents is that they married at a young age, and begat children at a relatively young age too. In comparison to my generation, their priority was finding a wife/husband and start a family without delay. I've noticed too that in my parent's generation, more people got married back then whereas now, the becoming trend is simply "living" together under cohabitation law. But this may not be true for everyone, but culturally speaking, a generation ago, having a kid outside the bonds of marriage was frowned upon, but now, it has become more culturally acceptable.

Another thing that has surprised my parents is the way kids interact with older adults in my generation. I remember my mother telling me years ago about her childhood that growing up, joining a conversation with older people was culturally unacceptable. She said that when kids join a conversation between adults was a considered disrespectful. As a punishment, they were spanked or pinched. But now, this once was culturally acceptable behaviour has somehow become acceptable.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[1. Motivation: My parents are certainly more motivated than I am. I find them up early on weekends, they work hard at work even if they don’t enjoy it sometimes, and they see most things as challenges rather than burdens. I, on the other hand, can barely roll out of bed after sleeping in for an hour, I slack off at work when I’m not enjoying it, and I see lots of things as another box to check off on my ‘to do’ list.

2. Money: My parents work to save. Whether its for retirement or for next week’s groceries, they are constantly thinking ahead and saving for the future. As of right now, I work to spend my money. We both spend on food, just I like to spend it on lunch at school or dinner with friends.

3. Patience: Compared to me, my parents are extremely patient. They are willing to wait in lines without checking their phones or cooking complicated dishes for the perfect flavours instead of opting for instant noodles. They don't find the need to be distracted when doing chores that I consider boring and time consuming.

4. Values: Growing up and even now, my parents valued being successful. They went to university hoping to become working professionals who own their home in suburbia. These days, I value my individuality and creativity most. I hope the freedom of being unique is prominent in my future too.

5. Appearance: My parents never felt this weird social pressure to look picture perfect all the time. I think they had a happier childhood, in a way, because they didn’t constantly worry about how good they looked or what others thought of them because of how thin they were. I think this wave of commercial marketing and media has a lot to do with setting a social standard of how everyone should look and behave.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[My parents are constantly debating and talking about how different their school education was from my brother’s education and mine. In high school and middle school, there were several videos shown in my classes whereas when my parents went to school they did not watch videos in class. The level of information their teachers had shared about them was also different. This is in the way that teachers will tell students about their personal lives whereas when my parents went to school the information they knew about their teachers went as far as their last name.

Wearing pajamas outside or to work was not seen as appropriate when my parents were younger. Today it seems to be acceptable for people to wear their pajamas out to the stores, work, classes, and just going out for a walk. This is also a reflection of the how the perspectives of articles of clothing have changed.

Freedom is a large aspect of how my parents see the difference between my generation and theirs. The freedom to do what they wanted when they were younger is different from how it is today. 
The freedom to be a child and run out on the street to play hockey is one large difference that can be seen between the two generations. The freedom from technology was more prevalent when they were younger. They were not constantly addicted with the need to check a technological device every minute.  

The acceptance of different sexualities such as the gay, lesbian, bisexual, transsexual, asexual, and intersexual community was not accepted when they were growing up. Due to the perspective they were brought up with regarding sexuality, they themselves find it hard to view these communities as appropriate or as having the same terms used to describe their relationship status. My mom in particular does not think that the word marriage should be used for anyone in these communities who wish to legally 

The level of access to television entertainment is a large difference that my parents constantly talk about. The repetition of television shows was never around when they were younger. They talk about how the Ed Sullivan show would actually close down or stop city activities]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[My mother grew up on a farm, and I was raised in a city so there are quite big differences that way. I never had to do the sheer amount of extra chores and work she needed to. 
She also went to school 7 days a week because her parents brought her to a German language school on Saturdays and she went to Sunday School as well.

In social media, a lot of people I know in my parents generation won't message you to ask how you're doing. They'll post a comment on something random that you shared to ask about you and then try to carry on a public conversation about it. 

My parents went to school for a career and stuck with that career for decades, not switching jobs too often and usually not switching types of work. Whereas today it feels a lot more fluid and people can change careers quite easily without too much backlash.

One thing specifically that my parents did differently than I am and a lot of other families is that my dad didn't really work after he left university. My mother worked to support the whole family by herself. My husband and I are both working and trying to find a way for us both to do what we want instead of leaving the other in a place they don't want to be. 

My parents generation in my family also tend to get together for "tea" and they will drink tea and talk for hours in someone's kitchen. Pretty much all the time when I want to catch up with someone I know, it's online or we go out to a coffee shop.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[One of the main differences between my generation and my mothers is independence. My mom was very close to her parents and relatives. They would help out financially and if she ever needed anything she knew she always had the families support. In comparison to myself, I am very independent when it comes to most things in my life. Financially, I never take my moms money to pay for anything. I earn my money to pay for what I want and need. Even when it comes to food, I usually make dinner myself if my mom is away at work or is unable to cook.
Another big difference is the relationships between the different generations. My mom is very open towards me but she was not towards my grandmother. For example, I can openly talk about my personal relationships with my mom but she could not do it openly with my grandmother. My grandmother and grandfather would most likely bring up the word “marriage” if she ever talked about relationships.
Personal interests are also a big difference. I don’t have much in common with my mom when it comes to tv shows or music we listen to. I am mostly interested in rap or hip hop while she likes her Indian music. When it comes to tv shows, I like action and violence but she tends to like watching tv shows about love or marriage.
Another big difference is the way we spend money. My mom does not spend a lot of money on useless things. When it comes to my wallet, I like to spend money on food, liquor or whatever else satisfies me. In my view, I believe money comes and goes. My mom barely spends money outside of things such as groceries or stuff for the house.
A very common difference is the way in which we interact with people. My mom would talk in our native language Hindi and I would just talk in English. She is very traditional in how she interacts with people. For example, if I had guests over at my house my mom would make tea and serve food. I would probably open up a beer if a male guest was present. That’s it. Knowing that there is a big difference just shows that the younger generation in my culture is much more modernized than the previous generation.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Differences between generations.

1. Rebellious: I find that it’s quite obvious that our generation compared to my parents is that we are way more rebellious. Some of the things I’ve done and the things my brother and sister have done, my parents often say that they wouldn’t ever think of doing the things we do. I feel like this generation has much more of a chip on their shoulders which makes it difficult to respect others and follow authority. Not saying that it’s always a bad thing but I do think that when rules are broken we tend to not care as much.

2. We are greedier:  I find myself that we are way greedier. We want the best type of technology that’s out, or the best shoes, car, clothes, whatever it may be, we are always trying to “one-up” another. Whereas, in my parents generation they would ware the same type of boots (my dad loved his cowboy boots and would wear them until the soles were worn out) or jeans until they had holes in them. They never had to go out once a week to buy something new or have 20 pairs of shoes. The way my parents have talked about the way they grew up makes me kind of jealous. They just lived life, and enjoyed what they had and were given.

3. Trust: These days, again, with technology we can send a quick text and make simple plans and we meet family and friends at a specific time, although most of the time (at least for me most of my friends are never on time). In previous generations when they wanted to make plans whether it was to hangout, or have business meetings they picked a time and they had to trust that they would be there on time. 

4. They experienced what real “dating and flirting” was: Because of technology we are just people hiding behind our phones (well a lot of us).  It’s so easy to be “catfished” in our generation now. Everything they did in regards to dating and flirting was done in person, never through technology behind a screen and a keyboard. We just expect things to work out or be the same as face-to-face interaction.

5. The way we think: Hearing stories from my parents and grandparents just fascinates me. The way they thought back then was nothing compared to the way we think now. The way life was lived back then was so easy, sure there was stress here and there but my parents just kind of took things day by day, they didn’t think about the world. Our generation now seems to be thinking about money and we need to make this amount to pay for this and that, as if we are just working to live a luxurious lifestyle. Our generation is thinking about the future too much instead of enjoying the simple things and being happy with a simple life. At the same time, I think that those are just our harsh expectations in our generation.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Coming from a traditional Chinese family and living in North America right now, there is a big contrast on how my family views things, and how I view things. One obvious example would be the difference in language, as my parents grew up speaking Chinese their whole lives and I grew up speaking English due to the fact that most of friends only spoke English.

Besides the language difference, there is also the way how we present ourselves to others. I don't know if this applies to all Chinese cultures, but my parents are quiet and withdrawn, only saying "Hi" quietly when they had to. But for me, I like to talk to others and not always be very quiet. As well, my jobs requires me to be outgoing and friendly, not quiet and shy.

Another contrast would be in terms of clothing style choices'. Back when my parents were growing up, I saw old pictures of them always dressed very conservatively and "safe." Their parents dressed the same too. Very conservative and colours that matched their genders, for example: pink for girls and blue for boys. But now, clothing styles are more "crazy and wild," boys gelling their hairs into crazy spikes, and girls dressing like boys, or showing more skin in the summertime. 

One really big difference between my parent's generation and mine is the health aspect. Almost on every corner of the street, there is a gym, a gym exclusively for men or women, and almost all my friends, male and female, all have a gym membership. The health craze is very popular right now. But, back when my parents were growing up in Hong Kong, working out is not popular at all, and eating healthy wasn't too big of a trend either. My mom took me to Hong Kong to visit her parents there in 2011, and I can't even recall seeing a gym there too. 

The most major difference between my parent's generation and my generation is how we view life should be lived though. When my parents were growing up, it was viewed as school is the most important thing to their lives. School came above all else. Now I know some people may see this as an asian stereotype, but it is true in a sense, just may not be exaggerated as much as some others may have put it. But in my generation, while school is still really important, some people may see other things as a priority over an education, like having a family, religious practices, and pursuing their own dreams which may not reflect on having the best education. I find that living in my generation in North America is much more "free-spirited" in a way.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Lifestyle: I find that in my parents generation the lifestyle was more simple, go to school, find a job, get married young, and then have kids. In our generation I feel that we don't follow what that certain way of life. My generation seems to be more open and free. People aren't always marrying young and people are travelling more and “finding” themselves. Our generation is more open and social media is a big part of that. Our generation uses social media like Facebook and Instagram which allows people to see into each others lives  while my parents generation  was more private.

Learning: The way my generation learns and how my parent’s generation learns differs in that our generation has more accessible resources. We have technology to lean on as my parents did not. When I need to figure out how to fix something I just google or youtube it but when my parents needed to fix something they had to be patient and be hands on to figure out how to fix things themselves.

Communication: The way my generation communicates is through technology and social media. I find my self on my phone and texting more than actually talking. Also social media like  Facebook, snapchat, Instagram, are used more to communicate with people. I also find that when I meet someone I typically ask for their social media instead of their phone number as to my parent’s generation, when they wanted to talk to someone they would pick up the phone and call them, or meet them in person for a coffee or lunch. They would also write letters to their friends if they were from out of town.

Ethics: My generation seems more entitled as my parents worked hard and earned whats theirs. We expect things to be done for us like having dinner prepared, doing laundry and even paying for things. When something new comes out we need to have it right away while my parents were not as materialistic.

Awareness: Compared to my parent’s generation I find that my generation is more environmentally friendly and aware. When I go to the mall I see separate trash cans for different materials. Items that you buy now are mostly “eco friendly” and made with less materials.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think I’m similar to my parents. I even look like my dad when he was 18…haha.

1. We spend our time differently. 
My parents spend most of their free time watching T.V. They’re even getting bored of Netflix. How does that happen? My friend’s mom watches a lot of T.V. to kill time. I guess it’s because she’s a housewife and can’t find much to do. I think they’re not creative with their time as they once were my age. I spend my time playing videogames, going to school, and socializing with people.
2. Drinking and…
My parents seem to drink alcohol 3-4 times a week. It seems like they do it because it’s a habit and they built a dependence on it, or they are just bored.  I see it a lot when my parent’s friends come over to drink a lot. They do it bi-weekly. I do it when a group of friends and I arrange a day to drink. 
3.  Physical activity
I like physical activity, and I have experienced a lot of weight gain/loss in the past year and a half (140lb-200lb-170lb-190lb-180lb). My friend’s and I enjoy doing sports such as: baseball, swimming, and soccer. However, my parents are out of shape, and unmotivated to do any physical activity. My mom takes the car to a grocery store that’s 5 blocks away. It pisses me off when she says “take the car”, when I need something from the store.  It’s only a 5-minute walk. I also find that parents do not have the best physical appearance. Maybe it’s because they aren’t forced to do physical activities like how we were in high school. Nonetheless, I find some people are starting to ‘fall off edge’ such as myself in a couple of years? ☺
4. Doing stupid shit
My friend’s and I enjoy doing stuff out of the norm. A couple of us at midnight called each other up to go biking to downtown and back. We live close to each other, so from the bottom of royal st. to downtown was our goal. There and back. Guess what? We did that. The whole trip was 4 hours and 30km. A couple of ourselves almost experienced death twice: One on Granville st. bridge and 1 while being paralyzed with cramps in the middle of the road. My parents on the other hand never do anything ‘stupid’. Maybe because they experienced it when they were our age, and got bored of it?
5. Rituals
Damn, I hate these.  I have to say grace during a thanksgiving dinner. I have to celebrate Christmas. I have to celebrate birthdays. I just want to do my own thing. My one friend was texting my friends and I during his family dinner, saying he would drive his car at 80km/h to see us. He really wanted to get out. My parents, and other parents care about ritual. I suspect it’s a tradition that would ‘bond’ us together and prevent us from distancing.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[My friend broke up with her ex. because her parents referred her ex. as 'an it'. She broke up with him because she didn't want conflict with him and her parents. Her and her parents are Chinese, and her ex. was Filipino. I feel our generation is looking at things in a different way. The way my friend wanted to date a Filipino guy and found it socially acceptable, but vice versa for her parents. We are being more fond of accepting one for who they are, rather than rejection and accepting prejudice.]]></wp:comment_content>

I'm of Mongolian and German descent, and they were willing to accept me if I was gay.

I'm just sayin' that not all of their generation were brought up to view non-straight people a taboo.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[One difference between my generation and my parents’ generation is fashion. Looking through my parents yearbooks, I didn’t notice too many differences in the clothes they were wearing. Most of them were simple shirts, usually plain, striped or plaid, and I would rarely see any graphic designs. Nowadays, we notice more differences in fashion as there are way more different brands of clothing available with more unique designs. Also, my parents do not understand why some guys sag their pants, because that was never done back when they were in school.

When my parents were younger, marijuana was not as popular as it is today. It was seen as dangerous, and the people who smoked it were seen as “losers” and not part of the “cool” crowd. Nowadays, most people know others, or have friends who partake in smoking marijuana, and it is seen as more of a popular activity, that many now believe to be less harmful than drinking alcohol or smoking cigarettes.

Driving then and driving now are two different processes. At my age, my parents just had to write a test to get their first drivers license, and then after 2 weeks, they could get their full license. Now we have a much stricter program implemented to increase safe driving that involves getting a learner license for a year and then a novice license for 2 years before we can get a full license. Also, with sky trains and buses widely available, we have a wider variety of options to transport ourselves to where we need to go.

When my dad was in school, he witnessed a teacher throw a chair at a classmate who was whispering to his friend during a lecture, If this was ever done in 2015, that teacher would definitely be fired and would likely be sued by the student or student’s family.  Teachers also could smack student’s hands with their rulers, which is thankfully unheard of now.

One last difference is that when my parents graduated from high school, it was expected that they take out student loans and move out from home as there was not a wide variety of post secondary institutions nearby to choose from. Currently, there are more post secondary institutions available with more choices of areas of study so that it is easier to live at home and save money while still attending a school that is not too far away.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[1) Millitary. My dad served in the millitary, and so did his dad before him, and his grandpa. I think the political climate plays a large role in this, as my dad joined the marines during the cold-war era (where russia was seen as a very real threat to the US, and vice versa). 

2) War. My mom lived through the iran-iraq war,whereas now (in Canada) our generation doesn't have to worry about bombs being dropped on us. Her friends all can relate to the hardships of the conflict, whereas I can't, and I know none of my friends can relate to the realities of war. Also, my generation does not have to worry about the economic effects war can have ( mass unemployment, lack of resources, etc).


3) Both my parents were raised in religious families. However, they did not raise me in any way to be religious. It is more common for our generation to openly discuss things such as atheism, agnosticism and spirituality than it was in the past. My parents were raised that the only way to find any sort of faith was through the Church - Organised religion.  I have a few friends that go to church - but the majority don't (But that is probably because I don't go to church myself, so I meet less people that go to church).

4) children. my mom and my dad became married really early (at 18) and, and were already parents by the time they were 20. I am 20 right now, and the idea of me having a kid is just nonsense to me. My generation has differing views on marriage/children than my parents. My parents wanted children early on, it was a priority in their life, whereas in my generation no one that I know even talks about wanting kids at my age.


5) being connected. My parents generation had to meet someone up to find out what was new in their life. Nowadays, we can just text each other and not have to wait until the next time we see each other to tell a funny story or just to have a conversation. My parents had telephones in their house, but it was the family telephone and they didn't really have long conversations with friends on it, other than to make plans. Now that we have cell phones with data (internet) access, we can always stay in touch with work/friends/etc. Our generation uses social media and technology to the point where we really aren't totally 'isolated' from our friends when we don't see them, same with other family members. My parents generation never had this luxury, and other than writing letters/telephone calls in the living room, the only other way to catch up with someone or see how they were doing was the pretty much go see them.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Spoiled:
	Back in my parent’s generation, everyone had to work hard for a living and it was not common to have a lot of money in a family. This resulted in the children having to grow up fast and work hard to help out. Parents don’t want their children to have to go through the same thing so a lot of parents spoil their children. When children are given everything they want, they don’t learn to value what they have or to work hard. This can lead to 30 year olds still living in their parent’s basement. This happens because they were never taught how to grow up so they never did. Back in my parents generation it was not common at all to just stay at home until “you figure out your life.” Instead, you had to grow up, get married, and move out.

Self entitled:
	Our generation is constantly being told that “you are special” and that there is no normal so you should be whoever you want to be. As good as this might be for self-esteem, it also makes people very selfish. People are seeing themselves as more important than everyone else instead of just the same as everyone else. This results in people being rude to others that aren’t as high of class and having no respect for anyone else. Back in my parent’s generation, most people had the same office job, the same car, and the same size house. This similarity brought people together.

Access to knowledge:
In our generation, it seems that we are at a place with technology that allows us to have complete knowledge. This actually causes the opposite of that. Instead, people have less knowledge than ever before because there is no need to store it in our brains. Cellphone have totally changed the game of accessing knowledge because now people always need answers. Years ago before cellphones, kids would hang out and ponder things like “I wonder who sang that song on the radio” and they would just leave it at that. There was no way for them to find the information and they were okay with that. At the same time, if the answer came to them it was a lot more satisfactory. Today, we aren’t okay with not having an answer. There is certain impatience in play. 

Attention span:
	On that note, our generation has a very shorter attention span than that of our parent’s generation. Our parents had to withstand the terrible act of waiting in lines, watching commercials, waiting for buses, and actually accepting awkward social situations instead of resorting to their phones. Now, people can’t handle waiting for commercials because they are so used to skipping through them. A dead cell phone is a tragedy to people because they have to actually entertain themselves while waiting at the bus stop. We always need to be stimulating our brains instead of enjoying silence. It’s an interesting transition how technology had greatly advanced our society but also has harmed it.

Communication:
	The way that we communicate with each other has drastically changed to become very informal. It doesn’t seem that the respect for elders has gone down but that the approval of more casual conversations has increased. Communication with anyone above us has come to shooting a text out instead of making a formal phone call or calling a meeting. In my parents generation the way people talked to other of authority was very professional and very polite.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[There are certainly several differences between my up bringing and my parents up bringing. Two of the main differences that comes to mind is education and relating to that is our growing economy. There are currently countless opportunities in terms of career choices and how students are educated. Research has been conducted over the past decade and it has been found that not everyone learns the same. Therefore, the historical lecture method (the way our parents were taught) is not always the most effective since there are auditory learners, visual learners and people who learn better by completing hands on activities. Technology assists with this by introducing new, innovative programs for people of all ages including iPad apps, Youtube tutorials/lectures, and the new Smart Board which is now used in most classrooms, especially at the primary level. 

As our economy continues to expand, there is a high demand for trades people as huge projects such as the Evergreen Line and the Trans Canada Pipeline are constructed. These massive projects guarantee long term employment for those who prefer to work in a hands on environment. Another aspect on education and employment has to do with the amount of education required to attain a well paid career. Back when our parents were young, education after high school was not always a high priority. For example, my dad, who is now a Senior Project Manager for Vancouver Shipyards, does not have a degree. He simply went to BCIT in the eighties to become a welder and has slowly advanced his way up the company. Today this situation would not be as likely especially if he wanted to jump right in and become a project manager before he became a welder. 

Our generation has it good compared to our parents generation, almost too good. Many of us rely on our parents too much. When my parents were in grade 10 it was expected that they both get a part time job but nowadays there are several young people I know who do not have a job even though they have been out of high school for almost a year. Parents these days can be known as helicopter parents which does not strengthen a child's independence. I have some friends who ask there parents to come with them when applying for a job. It has become a little excessive and this is also why my generation chooses to live at home after high school. 

Another big difference between my generation and my parents is discipline. At school and at home it usually involved some sort of physical aspect. Whether that was throwing chalk or spanking these methods are typically not used in the twenty first century. In fact, if a mother is seen hitting her child in a public place it is very likely the police will be called.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[1.    Marriage:  There is a wide range of differences that have occurred between my parents' generation and my generation among marriage traditions.   My parents had arranged marriage that was very common and the norm in my country at that time. In my generation, this kind marriages have declined, and love marriage is most common. Back then, couples married at very young age and maintained healthy marriages throughout their lives. My parents were very young when they married; my mother was 19 years old, and my father was 23 years old and they have been married now for more than 35 years. Comparing to my generation couples are not marrying as young but the divorce rate is higher than ever.  Old generation had more commitments toward marriage. They  work their problem out and defiantly more responsible.  
2.    Family stretcher:  My parent's generation had a extended family structure; they are more likely be living with another family members such as parents or saplings and family headed by grandfather. After my parents marriage, they lived for three years in my grandfather house (the family house).  My father and his older brother had to support their Dad and younger sapling financially and most important socially. In my generation nuclear family stretcher takes place: family may  contain grandparents and headed by children’s father.In my generation, there are weak social and emotional links between family members; less social family gathering, less emotional   and social support. 
3.    Follow the laws of society; Old generation is more inclined to follow rules and live the way society has shaped them. My generation has difficulty to respect the authority; hard to follow parents' instructions, hard to accept government guidelines.  My parent's generation perceptions are shaped by growing up having to take care of themselves early and watching their politicians lie. My generation grows up sheltered and has protective parents and less ability to survival  with limited recourses.
4.    Pay Attention and stress tolerate: my parent’s generation has great attention abilities than my generation. Paying attention isn’t a problem because they used to take time to complete their work and get the work done; although, they had harder live circumstances.  My generation can’t complete work without Adderal and stimulant drugs. Consuming Alcohol and smoking marijuana to get rid of stress,  swallow cocaine and smoking crack in parties for fun!. My parents know and remember history events more  than me. For example, my father( 36 years old )  knows and  remembers  history events like world War 1 and 2 and my country history more than me: I always need to go back to reference.   
5.    Social Freedom:   my generation has more personal and social freedoms than my parents' generation. But are there  limits to our freedom expressions ?.  We are free to dress whatever we want, but is it part of our freedom to walk naked  in streets or to have “no pants sky train ride “ or free nipples events? My parents' generation was worried more about country freedom more than pants freedom as they lived through my country  war. Also, they believe that the freedom carry a message for next generation. What if the next generation girls decide to go schools with free nipples? .]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[1. Conservatism
My parent’s generation is far more conservative with their way of life compared to my generation. This is mostly because they grew up in a different environment where dressing or acting a certain way was frowned upon in the society. For example my mother finds things such as getting too many tattoos or piercing inappropriate.

2. Entertainment
More specifically my parent’s form of receiving entertainment is far different than it is for my generation. In my parent’s youth they had to go to the theatre to watch a movie compared to our generation where we had the option of DVDs when we were younger for movies and now we have it available online through Netflix. My parent’s generation was not able to watch movies wherever or whenever they pleased, it had to be specifically planned ahead of time.

3. Cartoons
This is more specific to my mom’s generation and environment. When she was younger she did not have access to many forms of cartoon or television shows. She told me that they would only come on at a specific time everyday and only for a short amount of time since she only had 2-3 shows to watch on TV. My generation had access to multiple different cartoon shows and they were also longer compared to her shows. 

4. Compromise
My parents generation was more understanding towards there parents wishes and were willing to compromise things for they’re parents. An example of this may be if a distant relative was visiting my parents had to compromise they’re time to visit that relative.  They had to attend all family functions with their parents. However, my generation is given the choice of wanting to attend an event or not. This may be because we are more distant with our relative compared to our parents, or our parents really disliked going to these events themselves and therefore they do not force us. 

5. Food
My parent’s generation did not have a lot of options for the food they wished to eat. Due to us living in a multicultural country and close to a city my generation has a lot of options for the type of food we wish to eat. My parents had to eat traditional food growing up, so something like noodles was eaten on special occasions.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Health and Fitness: Today health and fitness is largely promoted in school compared to when my parents attended school. In BC you’re required to take P.E up till grade 10 then it becomes optional up to grade 12. The knowledge I retain in health and fitness is different compared to my parents. My mom thought if I continued to work out I would get cancer. Speaking of cancer, my parents believe almost anything will give you cancer.

Family Size: Both of my parents came from a family of 8 plus where as I’m an only child. My cousins are also an only child or have 1 sibling. According to google the average size of the family has decreased. I believe this because times have changed, my grandparents had big families to help work on the farm.

Objective in life: My objective in life is completely different from my parents. My parent’s objective was to move to Canada and start a new life. They wanted to find a job and support their family back in the Philippines. My objective on the other hand is to make something of my life. Instead of just working to make money, I want to love my job.
 
Connectivity: Anytime of the day we have access to unlimited sources. We can quickly find a fact in a matter of seconds or text someone across the world, where as in my parents didn’t have the sources to do what we can do today. I remember my dad having those block like phones and man were they huge. We get smaller phones that can out match those phones easily.  Although there is a gap, my parents are adapting to the technology. They both have laptops and tablets but the knowledge of the device is completely different from mine and theirs. I still help them with small things from here and there.

Video Games: At an early age I was introduced to N64, playstation and other gaming formats. Throughout the years gaming console had advance. I have a wii, ps3 and xbox 360 at home. My parents on the other hand had nothing like this. Our generation is heavy on the video games and is continuing to grow. I played a lot outside as a kid but today a lot of kids are glued to their tablets.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Well I should not have waited this long to do this task but I still have some differences that haven’t been listed yet. Some will sound pretty random but I have been thinking about this for a while so bear with me. 
The first thing I thought of was the dental system we have now versus what my parents grew up with. I am a huge whiner when it comes to going to the dentist because I always have a cavity here and there and I find the needles/freezing to be unpleasant. My parents always get frustrated with this because they never got any freezing or proper dental care. They always go into gory detail about what it’s like to get a tooth pulled out with no freezing and my grandparents do this as well. They remind me that the dentists in their time would use their body weight as force to extract their teeth and to be grateful that I have access to proper dental care today. 
Another is neighbourhood friendliness. My grandparents especially and my parents both like to make conversation with their neighbours. They find it really important to know who lives around you and stay connected with them or friendly at least. I can understand where they are coming from however I find this generation tends to stick their headphones in and keep their eyes down. I notice it all the time on my street, kids just find it awkward to say hi or wave anymore so that sense of neighbourhood community is disappearing- at least from what I have noticed.
A third is eating meat. I haven’t been able to eat meat since I was a child. I connect with animals and am more educated about how they are slaughtered than my parents are. While they were growing up animals weren’t slaughtered nearly the same way. They still think that animals live on these nice farms and have pleasant times in their “free range” enclosures. They also don’t want to know the truth about what happens today- the transport of farm animals alone in Canada is an embarrassment.  I find this a big difference because they chose to be ignorant of what happens to the animals because then it doesn’t bother them and they can continue to eat the way they do.  I notice a lot of our generation has chosen to go vegetarian or vegan and not because “omg an animal has to die” but because of HOW they have to die. 
Skin exposure on television is another difference. When my parents were growing up they did not have women in super tiny outfits or underwear dancing around. This year while I was watching the Victoria secret fashion show for instance, my mom came downstairs and nearly had a heart attack. She finds it distasteful and that’s because while she was growing up it would’ve been considered “pornography” according to her. However we are so exposed to actors being half naked all the time it hardly phases us anymore and we wouldn’t consider a fashion show porn. 
The last thing I will add here Is that my parent’s generation tends to lean towards the idea that if a girl gets raped she somehow “asks for it”. Whatever the excuse they always put the blame on the girl and what she did to deserve it instead of the guy who thinks it’s okay because the girl was wearing a short skirt or drank too much alcohol. I notice in this generation that social media plays a large role in educating people our age about rape culture and changing the way we view rape. My parent’s generation especially in other cultures like India view women who are raped to have a lesser value and sometimes will not be considered for marriage. Thankfully with this generation and the awareness being raised on the issue there is a shift being made slowly.  
Some of the things listed here are controversial and I am generalizing when I say my parent’s generation etc. I know that’s not how everyone’s parents feel, but for the module I took the way the majority of them feel.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Sports- Sports have changed tremendously since my parents generation. From rule changes, to instant replay, to better equipment many things have upgraded. There are now even several changes such as TSN and Sportsnet that are solely decimated to sports which never existed back in the day. 

Groceries- the amount of new technological you can online has revolutionized so many areas in our day such as online grocery shopping. Back in the day there were only a few stores you could go to do get your groceries. Nowadays there are so many choices and you can actually now order everything you need and have it ordered to your door. Something my parents thought would never be even considered. 

Milk Delivered- another thing that has changed is that my parents used to have a milkman come around delivering milk to neighbourhoods. There is still even a little milk door on my house that families long ago used to have their milk delivered. Now that no longer exists and people usually go to the stores themselves to get milk rather from a milkman.

Online Course- the education system has changed significantly since the days of my parents attending school. Now such as this course you can take courses online from your own computer. Having this convenience has revolutionized the education and opened many more opportunities to do schooling from the comfortability of their home.

Features of TV- when my parents watched TV there was a few channel choices but now we have hundreds and hundreds including high definition, places where you can watch movies and TV shows such as Shaw On Demand and Netflix, and you can even rewind and forward to skip those dreadful commercials. All these amazing features that my parents are so in love with because they didn't have this growing up.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Since I am later to post, ill list some very specific ones that I think are relevant.

Cyber bullying: I see this as a major problem today, one that is getting worse. Whereas in my parents generations, if someone was bullying you, you could beat the hell out of them and that was that. Today, people are ruthless and cowardly in the way they bully people online i.e posting pictures, making facebook groups to shame someone etc.. I see this as a major concern for the future.

Marital Temptation: By this I mean, temptation to cheat on your significant other. There is more temptation than ever before.  To name one example of the greater temptation there are agencies, such as ashley madison.com, specifically made for married people to cheat on their spouse.  Or when an ex girlfriend adds you on Facebook, nothing good can come out of that!  I feel this is a huge contributor to why marriages are less likely to work out for the younger generation. Marriages today will almost always involve some degree infidelity on the part of one or both members.

Being handy: Ask someone of our parents generation to help with a project. Notice they are much more likely than a person in their 20's to be able to perform home maintenance tasks, such as basic drywall repair, or plumbing work. I notice it especially at work, where a lot of people my age are not nearly as handy as people of our parent's generations.

Nationalism: Today I believe there is a much weaker sense of national pride. This may have something to do with people who come to Canada to live a better life, but don't really want to give anything back. Also, relate this to people who would volunteer to fight in a major overseas military campaign,and today I think relatively few people would volunteer, compared to the huge percentage of canadians in the 1940's for example. 

"Til death do us part":Someone has already mentioned marriage in a way but anyway this quote used to mean something. Today, people will marry but from the start they will keep finances to themselves etc. in the event that it doesnt work out. Many of our parents have been together 20-30 years or more but compare that to people our age who are getting divorced at a rate of 50 percent or more.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Knowledge of Food and Nutrition: This generation focuses heavily on eating right and getting enough exercise compared to the generation 30 years ago when healthy eating wasn't a "thing". Nowadays there are plenty of variety for everyone depending on their lifestyle choices to junk to healthy produce . For example, organic and natural food has blown up in the last 50 years because of new discoveries on GMO and the effects it has. A lot of awareness from where we get our food has been put in the spotlight, schools, media, and work etc. People of this generation fortunately have more knowledge so they can choose what is best suited for them and their lifestyle. Whereas majority of other people's parents mostly ate what were available and given to them.  

Animal Rights: No one really cared about the welfare of animals in my parent's generation, there were no organizations to protect animals such as BCSPCA, PETA, and WWF etc. My parent's generation in China overhunted sharks for their fins (to make shark fin soup, a delicacy) and put them back in the water for them to die. The value of animals has been drawn to more people's attention. There are specific organizations and laws restricting the hunt for sharks now. Animals feel too!  

Partying and Raves: Since the late 90's the rave scene and parties has been seen as dirty, grungy and full of drugs. "Rave Culture" is a big thing in North America and the rest of the world, with music festivals costing as much as $400. My parents saw raves and parties like it was for junkies, but now with proper event organizers and the attention is gets year around, they don’t see it as a threat to us young adults. Especially if we are educated and know how to stay safe. 
Work Load: In my parent's day, especially when they were young in their home country, they had no time to rest. It was work, work, work all the time, I would say my work ethic cant be compared to theirs. It was the fact that they had to hustle for my grandparents, money never came easy for them. It's was always nonstop work for them and I have the privilege to go to school and not worry.  

Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence: The difference between this generation and my parents generation were the existence of outlets,  understanding and platform against violence. Women were  were looked down upon and if they told anyone it would put shame on their family. Feminists have coined the term "Rape Culture" to bring awareness because of the lack of awareness about how often it actually occurred. Even though rape is still considered a "taboo" to some, it is more talked about openly than before. The attitudes my parents had about walking out late at night when they were younger were definitely more careless than nowadays.  They don't ever want me walking out late at night alone because I am a female and because of their idea of sexual assault and violence from the news. This was to show how perspectives had changed because of the platform and awareness over the years. I had no intention of bringing negative 'differences'  but to only bring highlight to society's view of being a female and being able to safely roam the streets alone has changed.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Might I also add, men are victims of domestic violence too and there wasn't much of an understanding of the issue because of the shame it brought to the men. More reports have been made over the past generations as it is more talked about and the men were brave enough to come forward. Past generations haven't even shone light to the abuse from women but more and more social media outlets have shown the truth of abuse and how it can happen to anyone and anywhere.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi! You are most definitely right. The idea of religion has changed, back in the days you had to be a certain type of follower of some religion because your parents were raised a certain way. Now we have the freedom to choose our religion and practice what we want. I love how you touched base on that! It's so important to have your own beliefs. My aunt was raised Buddhist but converted to Christianity when she moved to Canada when she was introduced to it when she was at a low point in her life. She is a strong believer of God and practices the religion.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[My parents are both Filipinos and lived away from the cities in the Philippines. During childhood, they lived in prairie like towns, accustomed to certain ways of upbringing and expectations. In their generation, leisure activities consisted of enjoying how nature presented itself. They would play out in the rice fields, ride on carabaos or water buffalos, and climb trees, hopping from one tree to the other, or fruit picking like guavas and wild fruits. Also, instead of them staying up late because of Netflix, or some online game, my parents in their youth played late night chess or answer riddles among friends outside their houses, they would have a lot of people watching, placing bets on whoever they think would win. This usually occurs when there is a full moon out. It would almost look like a feast since neighbors would go outside, both children and adults.  They would sing songs with a guitar playing alongside them, children would play hide-and-seek in the dark, and other traditional Filipino games that youth right now in the Philippines do not play anymore. Another difference is how almost all relatives either from father and mother’s side lived with the whole family in one big house. My mom would always tell me that her aunties, and uncles, and grandparents lived with them for quite a long time. Often, she would also share bedrooms with cousins aside from sharing with her three siblings. My parents would also recall that every meal of everyday is to be shared with the whole family, most especially dinner time. There was a time set for dinner that all family members must be present in. As an example, my mother said that by 6 o’clock, everyone must be home and ready for dinner, share how their days went, since dinner is mostly the time where everyone would have the chance to share stories, have laughs, and voice up their concerns. Their dinners would last almost two hours over hilarious stories, and endless conversations about friends, school, and happenings they encountered that day. Lastly, according to old sayings, my mother would say that waking up early in the morning is essential to the success for the rest of your day. I asked my dad about this, and both my parents agree that from waking up early, you receive all the blessings from the rising sun, and from up above. Essentially, this helps complete tasks you are about to do for that day. I always loved hearing stories from my parents’ childhood, especially my mom’s, they sound so adventurous and more exciting than how youth live their lives today.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for taking the time to read my post, Nicole! 

I guess it's just our parents and the way there were brought up. They've lived like that their whole lives and it would be really difficult to just change in an instant. And, I suppose all cultures do have some similarities too.

I read yours as well, and I definitely agree with how our generation thinks too much about the future (I find myself doing that sometimes too), instead of just living life and enjoying every single day. It'd be cool to go back to our parent's generation and living a couple days to see how that would be.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Tattoo's: The public acceptance and obsession with tattoos has increased from my parents generation to ours. Neither of my parents had any tattoo's before this past summer whereas all of my siblings and I had already had at least 2 each. People in our generation can get tattoo's by walk in appointment without a second thought. Not to say this applies to everyone and it certainly doesn't apply to my mother now whom within the past year has acquired 12 tattoos.... But just in general the accessibility and acceptability of them in the workplace and culture.

Reading: My parents generation were very well read - the level of novels that were published weren't the trashy teen-bopper vampire love stories that are engulfing my generation now. The language that was used was more challenging and the novels had deeper meanings

Hand written work: With the use of computers the era of knowing proper spelling and punctuation will soon come to an end. The calligraphy and ability to hand write letters and the art of beautiful writing will become digitized. My mother has an obsession with calligraphy and yet I'm not sure how to properly write a capital J in handwriting. 

Physical memories – photographs versus digital copies. The feeling of holding a picture in your hand and passing it around is so much more satisfying that flipping through a desktop folder. The increased amount of storage within a computer for pictures has made us snap - happy and willing to save everything. My parents (thankfully) still print off photo's from the year every Christmas for presents, but they're memories aren't within the amount of pictures but the memories the pictures are from. 

Health conscientiousness: Or perhaps it's paranoia, but our generation is more aware of possible health concerns about everything. Carcinogens, mercury et cetera. My parents generation did not have nearly as many warning labels or possible cancer causers  as we have now. My dad (who was a redneck) used to have frozen deer poop fights ( I don't need to explain that one). I'm not sure I know of anyone in this generation that would thing to pick up a frozen deer turd and chuck it at his buddy. Also our generation has an obsession with hand sanitizer and antibiotics.

Basically the tangible side of life - books, hand written work, picture memories - has been a main difference in the generation of my parents and mine, whereas we like the world to be virtual and kept online. 

As well (just had a brain blast) vehicle expression.  Now vehicles are bigger and louder, or sleek and aerodynamic. They are all shiney and round edged. I find the vehicles from my parents generation have box-ier lines and less "bedazzle" to them.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[1.	No electronics 
Consumerism in my parents’ generation compared to my generation is completely different. For example, in the way that we communicate. Our generation today is heavily reliant on technology and hand held devices for communication, whereas my parents’ generation never had a cell phone to communicate with other people while they were out. Generally, the most common way of communication for my generation is through text, however for my parents, they communicated through the land line phone whenever they were home. My generation is consumed with technology whereas my parents’ generation could live without it.
2.	Fashion
Fashion in the older generation has changed completely. My mother always used to talk about the way that she dressed and explained to me that fashion is like a cycle. One thing for her goes out of style and soon enough comes back into style. She finds that a lot of the clothes for my generation is a more provocative style of what she used to where. In her generation, there would almost never be any skin to show because it was improper for women to expose themselves. In my generation, crop tops and short shorts have become the social norms. 

3.	Intensity in sports
The intensity in sports have greatly increased from my parents’ generation to my generation. When my dad used to play volleyball in high school, he never had to go to weight training or practice 5 times a week. He was his own coach of his high school team and captain on the court. In my generation of sports, the programs are becoming more intense. Instead of sports being a way to keep active with no stress, the sports have become very competitive. In my high school volleyball career, I had to practice 5 times a week and weight train twice a week. On top of all this training, we competed in tournaments on the weekends. Students are training at a younger age than my parents as they began in high school for competitive sports to continue to college, but now in order to make a college team you must compete at such a high level that training usually begins in grades 5-6. 

4.	Education what we took in high school is there college level
Education in high school for my generation was equivalent to my parents’ generation of college education. The education system, just like sports, have become more intense. The requirements to get into universities have become more than just a high school diploma. In some universities, the requirements include volunteer work and work experience depending on the programs. The increase in intensity of education could be due to the fact that our generation is more knowledgeable about the world than my parents’ generation.

5.	Economically cost of living
The cost of living for my parents’ generation was much lower than our generation. The cost of gas has been a roller coaster for our generation but for my parents’ generation, the gas never reached over a dollar. The cost of food expenses are rising, as well as housing prices. Just paying for the necessities now are more expensive than my parents’ generation.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[War: Both of my parents were born and raised in Lebanon, and a majority of their lives were lived through war (that eventually stopped after they arrived in Canada). Based on what my mother has described to me over the years, living in a war-ridden environment was normal to her. More often than not, disputes between governments or different nations would be settled by fighting, rather than more civilized means seen today (although not necessarily always the case). The attitude displayed by a lot of the newer generations is how war is “bad” and that “fighting for peace” is counterproductive. Whereas back then, and still seen in certain parts of the world, war is simply means of settling conflict. 

Arranged Marriage: My parents only knew each other for a week before they got married, a marriage to which only lasted ten years. Arranged marriages are becoming decreasingly common in Lebanon, but the idea behind them is arguably not that bad. The ideal of saving yourself for marriage and for it to be an intimate occasion between two families, as well as individuals is great. Although I have the freedom to choose who I want to date and (one day) marry, having family approve of who I have chosen is really important.


Religion: Both of my parents grew up Islamic. And in Islam, the belief is that if a man and a woman get married, their children will always follow the religion of the father (even if the woman is of any other religion). This was the practice that they were taught by their parents, the religion they were to practice was the one their parents told them to. However growing up with just my mom, she never particularly enforced religion as something that I must believe in or practice. She had her beliefs, and understood that I may have differing ones, or a lack there of. The common theme of choice is prevalent again, as I now have the choice to believe in what I decide.

Choice: Since choice seemed to be a common theme with all of the examples given so far, I have chosen (ha-ha) to make it its own example. Over a not long period of time, there has been a shift of being reliant on parents or elders for guidance in decision making, to a more independent approach utilized today.

Lastly, I’m not sure what I should title it but maybe “Chores” is good? I must not be the only one, howver I do not think I noticed it as I read over the other comments. I continually hear my mom say “back when I was your age I did so much work around the house and cooked all the meals”. Meanwhile, it seems like I do only a fraction of that (a good day would involve me cleaning my room).]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[1)	Education was not important for my Dad growing up; he dropped out of school in grade 9 and has still always had a very good job. Presently I would have a harder time finding as good of a job, if I only went to school up until grade 9.
2)	Smoking cigarettes was extremely popular in the 80’s. My Dad said everyone use to have a cigarette hanging out of their mouths. Now I think that people realize that smoking cigarettes is very unhealthy and less people smoke them. 
3)	Moving away from home at an earlier age was far more normal then it is now. My Dad moved out of the house shortly after he dropped out of school and lots of his friends did too. I think that my generation is more dependent on their parents because of the amount of education people have to pay or because they’re too lazy.
4)	Internet access was never available for my Dad growing up. My generation is so dependent on google and social media networks that it would be hard to picture life without it. 
5)	The city of Surrey has changed a lot in the past 10 years as well. My Dad told me that when he first moved here, Surrey used to be all bush with small houses on big properties. Presently, Surrey is quite populated, houses are much bigger and bunched up in units and almost all the trees have been chopped down to build more houses.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Photo Theme Module - Part I</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Instructions:</strong> <em>Due for March 5th!!</em> This module builds on the two modules that proceeded it about <em>Moxyland</em>, definitions, differences, and recognizing themes for literary interpretation. This module has <strong>two parts</strong>. These instructions and actions cover Part I of the module. Instructions and actions for Part II will be posted to this webspace on March 6th, so be sure to check back. All you need to do for now is send me two pictures--no commentary needed; we'll get to that in Part II. 

<strong>Task:</strong> Take two photos (cellphone camera is fine) of something (an object, a place, a person; be creative!) related to what you see as representative of the themes in <em>Moxyland</em>. After taking the two pictures, Email (wrightd at douglascollege dot ca) them to me no later than <strong>March 5th at Midnight</strong>. If I don't receive your pictures by then, you will not get credit for this module. 

When thinking about and taking your two photos, you should be asking yourself how you conceptualize the themes in <em>Moxyland</em>. Ask yourself what you think the novel is about and what it is trying say. What statement is the novel trying to make and why? What is the underlying metaphor of the novel? Is it about Apartheid? Is about the fear being disconnected? Is it about friendship? Is it about betrayal? Is it about technology? Which part of technology is it about? How is the novel about technology? How might you represent themes through the objects you are photographing? 

In other words, don't just wander around and randomly take two photos--although that's one way of going about this assignment. Instead, be conscious of how your photo represents a theme in <em>Moxyland</em> as YOU SEE IT (so don't worry whether you understand the theme, or if it's the "right" theme). 

<strong>NOTE:</strong> When taking pictures of people, please be respectful of their privacy. If you are taking a picture of people (or a person) in a public space, ask their permission to take a photo of them or take the picture in a way that prohibits the recognition of faces (i.e.: from behind or the side).

<strong>Outcomes:</strong>

Hopefully, Part I of the module is fun. At the same time, thinking about the relevance of your photograph to the themes as you see them in <em>Moxyland</em> will prime you for Part II of the module. ]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Instructions:</strong> <em>Due before March 11th class</em> For those of you who submitted pictures, thanks. You'll see a bunch of contact sheets below that contain all the pictures submitted for this module. Your job now is to comment on a theme you see emerging from those contact sheets, using three of the photos to prove your point (sure, you can use your own pictures, but that's really lame and self-centred; this module not all about you dude).  

<strong>(If you didn't submit two pictures, you can do this part of the module (and you should!), but you lost your credit already. So, no grade for you on this module! But, we welcome your participation.)</strong>

<strong>Task:</strong> Tell us what theme you think THREE pictures represent. You should come up with the theme--it can be anything you think is reinforced by the three pictures. Make sure you describe the pictures and tell us what about the pictures (context, content, approach) is important for understanding how the pictures apply to your theme. We should be able to identify what picture you are talking about by how you describe what's relevant about it.  

<strong>The Pictures</strong> (You can click on the sheet to make the pictures bigger)

<strong>A few notes to help you complete this module:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
When writing about the theme you see emerging out of the pictures above, and when you are picking your three examples to reinforce that claim, try to think about the coherence of your evidence. How do the pictures signal the same theme exactly? What about the objects in the pictures reflect the theme?</li> 
<li>Avoid thinking about <em>Moxyland</em> for now. Think about what the pictures here show and what themes they reflect, then pick one of those themes and three examples.</li>
<li>For those of you who want to push things a bit, think outside the objects inside the pictures. What else is similar in the evidence (the angle the picture is taken from, the colours, the resolution). In others words, don't restrict your thinking about what the pictures reflect thematically to the content alone; what about other stuff?</li>
</ul> 

<strong>Outcomes:</strong>

<ul>
<li>We will build on your commentary in class next week, but this part of the module is trying to get you to think about coherence--how evidence goes together to reinforce your "decoding" of a theme.</li>
<li>Notice how the pictures already reflect similar broad themes -- technology for instance (how many of you took pictures of cell phones!?). But notice too how everyone's approach to taking a picture of technology is quite different. What this is trying to show you is how we need to refine and define how we are approaching broad themes by locating our thinking within specifics. When we say "technology," we mean a lot of different things. So, it's important to think about specific examples when we write essays about technology in texts.</li>
<li>Hopefully, what this module will also show is how you can put things together that are similar and arrive at different readings. The same three pictures can mean many different things depending on the context we put them in--being aware of this will make you a better reader and textual critic.</li>
</ul>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The picture of people on a transit system who are looking at their cellphones, I feel, gives a sense of dependence on technology—chained to their phones and eliminating social interactions amongst people. https://www.facebook.com/JOHNNYLIUPHOTOGRAPHY/photos/a.603692629654621.1073741834.461118003912085/666449843378899/?type=3&amp;theater Is a good photo that says we’re too ‘tangled up in tech’, just how people in the text are. The picture of resting homeless people can reference people who are disconnected. We often ignore homeless people on the streets, even when they’re begging for our scraps of change. I think we ignore them because they don’t look like they fit in with society. They don’t contribute to society, they look dirty and dirty. And we ignore them because of that. The theme, I think, is social status is important to people. It determines what benefits you get and lose depending on who you are.
The guy lying down on the field on a nice sunny day looks free. I think the theme is freedom. Something that most people never do is find their ‘inner self’ by stopping, and looking at the world for what it is and their position in the world. I personally like to look at trains and airplanes pass by with my friend because it’s nice to stop hitting the books and relax and think. It makes me think what my position, and others in the world are. Of course, that’s the result of freedom, and I do enjoy lying down back-to-back with my friend, and I do have to cherish it because other people have it worse than me. I think the book is about what we could lose, and cherish what we have now, because all hell can go loose at any time, causing use to things that we don’t value, making us ‘disconnected’.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The picture of the surveillance camera on the last row of photos, the police car on the fourteenth row of photos and the transformer box with the spray painted black and white eye on the twelfth row of photos represent the theme of public surveillance by a higher authority in my opinion. For most individuals, the presence of the police and placement of surveillance cameras in public areas deliver a means of safety while some believe it is an invasion of privacy. 

Surveillance cameras, police cars and transformer boxes share a similarity as they are common objects that are present on the streets and can be easily recognized by individuals when they are out and about in public. 

The spray painted eye on the transformer box is a visual metaphor of the theme as it represents the ‘all-seeing eye’ authority has on the public at all times by constantly monitoring actions and events taking place in society. Similarly, the surveillance cameras perform the actual deed of ‘seeing’ society by monitoring city streets, parking lots of shopping malls, the doors of banks and a multitude of other types of public locations. The photo of the police car represents the obvious, which is the presence of a form of higher authority in society. The photo of the police car is shown to be taken during the latter part of the day as it is dark out. In addition, the police car is parked on the side of a building with the absence of flashing emergency lights which could represent the random placement of police personnel as an attempt to monitor the public. 

All in all, the photos of the police car, surveillance camera and the spray painted eye on the transformer all contribute evidence to support the theme of public surveillance by a high authority in my opinion.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The fourth set of pictures contain a photo of a Monster Energy drink can, an Apple laptop, and a shot of a TV that is displaying a movie or show. Each of these photos have symbols that the average Western individual would instantly recognize. They represent forms of materialism and consumerism. 
The Monster Energy drink and the laptop show how quickly we are to recognize a brand. We know exactly what an image contains simply by seeing a bitten silver apple with a silver background. Right away, it’s easy to tell that the picture shows an Apple product, which Steve Jobs originally introduced. Without conducting any research, I’m aware of most of Apple’s products (iPhone, iPad, mac, iwatch, and iTunes). The average student will also recall the price ranges of most of their products and the setup of their store, the qualities that they have to offer, how their iOS system works, and have a basic understanding of how to use their electronics. This is a lot of information that one has knowledge of simply by noticing a brand. Personally, when spotting the Monster symbol on the black can, I didn’t need to read the words below the big green ‘M’ to know that it’s a Monster Energy Drink, similarly to most people of my age and culture. I’d also instantly remember the taste and price by seeing the drink. The photo of the TV is playing a show on Global TV, a channel on cable. Anyone who owns a TV and cable in North America will be aware of this channel and the shows that it plays. Most TV shows on this station are also American, which is evident by the big American flag stand in the photo. 
These are all photos of huge companies in North America. Apple and Monster are both American, which shows the influence that the United States has on Canadian consumerism. Instant knowledge of these popular brands also show the unconscious materialistic perspective that we have on the world and it’s industries.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The picture of the two washroom signs in the first set of pictures represents a theme of equality. There was a story on the news just last week actually that was talking about transgender individuals using the men’s/women’s washroom (man now women still feels comfortable using the men’s washroom but other men don’t feel comfortable with it, vice versa). But to me it shouldn’t really matter, if you feel comfortable using either washroom then do so. We live in a world where equality is something we are striving for. We need to learn to accept people for who they are. Although there are some risk factors to having transgender men and women using the “appropriate” washrooms, as the news said there have been cases of assault, we still should accept people, we don’t live in a “black and white/right or wrong” world anymore, a lot of things are grey. 

The second picture that caught my eye was again, in the first set. It’s the picture of the people on the sky-train but everyone is literally glued to their phones or some type of device. It’s amazing that we have to be so connected to twitter, instagram, texting, apps, email, and Facebook no matter where we go. Just like in the books we’ve read, technology now is such a huge part of our lives, who knows what it’s going to be like 10 years from now (it’s kind of scary to think about). The problem with staying connected all the time is we lose something in exchange for technology, we aren’t as social, we don’t like to talk face-to-face if we don’t have to, the list goes on and on. It’s sad to see that technology is affecting and keeping people “connected” of all ages.

The picture taken of the newspaper article, along with the surveillance cameras, police car, the intersection, all represent authority (hierarchy for the newspaper article about Ferguson).  I’ll start with the news article, this was such a big deal as it exemplified that yes, there still is racism everywhere but it also has to do with taking advantage of your job, responsibilities, and people. Not saying that the article is about racism but we’ve heard it all around the world, individuals in authority whether its driving a city bus, police officer, etc. take advantage of their responsibilities and I honestly think that some (not all!) people think they are better than others and use their position to their advantage. As for authority with the video cameras, intersections, they are all things that give us orders. Intersections tell people when to stop, go, turn left turn right. Cameras enforce obedience, we all act a certain way or different when we know we are being filmed. 

That particular photo was taken looking up at the cameras, which is a prime example of how we act when we see it, we walk in somewhere, see a surveillance camera, and immediately adjust our behavior.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think that a common theme through all the pictures posted has to do with technology. The amount of pictures of phones, computers and people on their phones portrays what our society as consumers. The theme that stood out to me most was our society being consumers.

The first picture that really stood out to me almost in shock was the picture of the family on the sky train. The whole family was on their phones and not paying attention to anyone around them. Our society is becoming more reliant and obsessed with technology. In this case the family was consumed by their cell phones. The connection was strong between the individual and their cell phone but a weak connection between each family member. Technology is becoming the most valued possession in people’s lives.

The second photo that stood out to me is the picture of the five dollar bill. Much like technology, money is highly valued in our society. We rely on money just as we rely on technology to live and just get us through life. As consumers, we use money to buy whatever is new and popular to keep up with the constantly changing fashion, vehicles or technology.

The last photo that I thought would also fit under a consumers society theme is the Iron Mountain truck. The advertisement on the back of the truck is formed to fit into our consumer’s society. Even vehicles are moving advertisements for businesses and products. 

I find that we cannot go through life without being a consumer in our society. Being a consumer is unavoidable. All three of these pictures are just different examples of how we are caught in the constant cycle of consuming the new products that are released so that we can keep up with our fast moving generation.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The majority of the pictures displayed seem to have something to do with technology. In my opinion, the picture with people on their mobile phones on the skytrain, the picture with the many hand held devices grouped together, and the interface of a smart phone all represent the theme of reliance on technology. In the novel Moxyland, technology plays a major role. Cell phones are important when it comes to the characters personal information and survival. When I look at these three photos, I see that technology is important to us but not as critically important as it is to the novels story.
I am not surprised at all when I see the photo of people on the skytrain using their mobile devices. From my own personal experiences in some of my classes, I have seen plenty of students using their mobile devices when we go on our breaks. It looks quite humorous but it just points out to the fact that humans are so reliant on cell phones. When I compare it to the four individuals using their cell phones on the skytrain, you can see a similar picture emerging but in a different setting. 
The second picture shows the many forms of hand held devices that people use for either entertainment or communication. The IPod and gaming devices represent ways in how we can entertain ourselves. For example, the Xbox controller is used as a hand held device to play video games on the Xbox. 20 years ago gaming would have never been considered as advanced as it is today. The many ways we can entertain ourselves has increased drastically due to the growth of technology. Gaming is such a big part of our entertainment industry that the younger generation relies on it for entertainment. 
The smart phone user interface is probably one of the most important when it comes to the reliance on technology. In this photo, it shows that a person can email another person, look at maps, and use the calculator and internet. Furthermore, this device has many more user functions. The interface shows that a person can communicate, do research, and perform other tasks all from this device at the palm of your hand. Personally, I rely on my smart phone to accomplish some of these tasks in a quick and easy way. 
From looking at some of these pictures, it is pretty clear that technology plays an important role in our day-to-day lives. Past generations were not as reliant on technology as we are today. Future generations will be even more dependent on technology as years go by. I still have a dazed look on my face when I see my 8 year old nephew play on an Apple tablet.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[A majority of the photos seen in this module represents the theme of a dystopian society that is mainly controlled by technology such as we see in Moxyland. Even in our world today we see how much of an impact technology has on our lives. In Moxyland we see the extreme of this as the government uses technology to control everything to a point where the citizens have no privacy or proper rights. 

The first photo that stood out to me was the surveillance camera. This is a technology that is used to monitor areas and ensure security. In Moxyland's dystopian society we can see that they use technology with cell phones to monitor everything that is happening and make sure it happens exactly how the governments wants it to happen. The second photo I chose is the photo of the police car. The police car also fits with the dystopian society theme as the police use technology with the cell phones and the biotechnology with the police dogs to ensure the society is controlled the way they want through technology. The third photo I chose is the picture of the people on the train all on there cellphones. We can see how our society today is so technologically based and how gadgets such as cell phones are such a big part of our lives. In Moxyland we see that the cell phone is a necessity to be connected and how Moxyland truly is a dystopian society.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[To continue on my point above that we can see through all three photos they represent a connected theme of dystopia. Without referring these photos theme to Moxyland we can still see the significant impact technology has on our lives. Technology is controlling how we go through our daily routines and how we will evolve and progress as life goes on. Its scary to actually think how dependent humans are on technology and that futuristic societies may be completely controlled by technology.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Dependency on technology is a dominant theme within most of these pictures, so is a higher authority surveillance/lack of privacy, which all point toward dystopia being a prominent theme throughout the photographs as well. Specifically the picture with the puzzle in the sixth row which exhibits a dystopian theme, the puzzle can represent a dystopian society by having the pieces all over the place instead of a picture of a well put together puzzle (utopian, well put together society).  The middle picture in the last row, of the art/graffiti displays a more frightening outlook on things. This can also represent a dystopia, it's more graphic monstrous look would not fit in with a happy, utopia. The appeal of it is more all over the place, chaotic and fits perfectly with the dystopian theme. The last picture in the eighth row, middle with all of the electrical cords tangled helps aid the dystopian theme. Again with being chaotic, unwelcoming, dysfunctional, disorganized, and an overall unappealing place or state to be a part of seem to be a reoccurring theme you get from most of the photos posted, but focusing on the three I pointed out, I feel they demonstrate a dystopia quite well.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Most of the pictures taken all have technology as the main theme. They can be seen as little bits of technology adding to the dystopia that created Moxyland. I want to try and analyze the pictures in a different light though. The theme I want to try and use is technology creating an almost utopia, instead of a dystopia.

The first picture I will use is the sunrise. This can be seen as a new beginning for technology, and the great new advancements that technology can bring to the human society.

The next picture I will use is the Douglas College "3600 Entrance" picture. I will be focusing more on the grey brick walls though. The thick brick walls represents the sturdiness of how much human society has evolved. From lighting fires for light to creating a mini-computer in the palm of our hands. The grey color of the think walls represents how new the technology is that the human society has their hands on. The foundation for new technology is here, but is still so new that society has to adjust to it. Almost like a new wall has been built, but still needs a color to be painted on to signify what the wall is for, what the person who owns that wall likes, etc. 

The third picture I will use is the American Flag with the man in it. This picture represents a new form of government coming to society. Like technology and human society, the government needs to evolve, as well. This new form of government will cater to the public more and be more welcoming to different ethnicities. An example of this would be Obama, a black man, becoming the President of the United States. The government will also listen to what the public needs more instead of catering to itself more. Thus, the world is becoming more of a utopia, catering to the general public. But, the flag is down because it is indoors. But, this could also signify that although the government becoming to cater more to the public, it can never cater to everyone's needs, thus becoming more and more of a utopia, but the world may never be a utopia to everyone's specific needs and wants.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The three pictures I chose to use for finding a theme are the people on their phones in the Skytrain, the screenshot of the different apps, and the different gaming consoles and phones on the ground.
They are representing the theme of technology but more specifically they represent the theme of how we use technology and how much it impacts our daily lives. The variety of gaming consoles and phones all have the same purpose for us today and that is to keep us entertained and connected. All the gaming consoles are used for the same purpose of playing a game most of the time but they are all made slightly different so people would buy more of them. The ipod in the image is for listening to music, which can also be done on the iphone in the image, but the iphone does not have enough memory to story all of the music most people have so they use the ipod as well. So although they all have the similar purpose, we have multiple different ways of performing those tasks.
In the top corner of the home screen screen shot I can identify two different apps for the purpose of listening to music. I similarly have multiple apps for music but that is because they all differ slightly so they can meet to my specific demands that I want in the moment. This can represent a theme of technology consumption due to the demand for more apps to perform tasks better than the last one the supply for different apps keep increasing. 
The amount of technology we consume is also a theme present in all of the pictures. It is shown best in the image of the people on the Skytrain on their phones. Instead of just sitting on the ride doing nothing or talking to person beside them they are all on their devices. This also shows the theme of communication, how we do less and less of face-to-face communication and more of digital communication. All of those people were most likely using their phones to communicate with people either through social media or text messages, even though there was a person beside them that they could have just interacted with.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[OOps please ignore the top part there. 
The three pictures I will discuss are 1) the top section photo in the second row that has a “quiet zone” sign, 2) the picture of a keyboard with the focus on the control key in the second section, top row and 3) the Fruitopia with the pills in the second section as well, bottom row. 
These photos share a common theme within the novel of control. Within the book the government controls everything the people do and enforce strict laws to ensure that the people don’t rebel and if they do the consequences are quite severe. As described in the earlier modules, Moxyland is controlled by a totalitarian government. Control is one of the most blatantly obvious themes because of the way the government controls the people, but the pictures kind of show a few examples of how obedience is achieved. There are drinks and pills for the characters to take in Moxyland that is shown in the photo above. Ghost is the popular soft drink because the people like Kendra who are injected with nano bots need the drink to refuel and stay sharp. Without it they start to fade and lose concentration and energy. As for the pills, in today’s society medication is a huge way that control is enforced. For example, in some elementary schools there are kids who have to take pills to control their ADHD/ ADD so there by giving the teachers control of their behaviour. 
The “quiet zone” sign could reflect the idea that in Moxyland you have to be careful about what is said in conversation. If the government doesn’t agree with the people’s opinions they will punish you because they can’t risk having any rebellious people. For example when Tendeka and ash are in the rally and are joined by hundreds of others, the government doesn’t bow down, they take extreme measures by spraying everyone with a deadly virus. The sign emphasizes how important it is to keep your opinions to yourself in Moxyland because if you don’t follow the rules it can cost your life.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The first picture that caught my eye was the women being arrested by police officers in the first set of sheets. The caption below states, “A demonstrator is arrested at an August protest.” Not knowing what the real situation is, the appearance of police in public especially at big events show that safety comes first. This gives the message to citizens that police will not tolerate any misconduct or behaviour that will jeopardize the balance of peace. 

The second picture I choose is the stop lights on the fifth set of sheets symbolizing how we deal with life. The green light represents to go ahead with life and see the different possibilities life can take us. When the light turns yellow, this can be a time where life is mediocre where things are only going average, nothing too special. In order to get ahead in life and do better, this is the time where we re-evaluate the decisions we’ve made and be extra mindful how the decisions we make will benefit or misguide us. In every success, there must be a downfall. At certain points in life, we feel vulnerable and feel as if nothing is going right. The red light indicates we have to stop, take a breathe and rethink how we are handling life because what we are doing isn’t working the way we want to. To get ahead, we must have a change in direction with a new perspective.    

The surveillance camera in the last of pictures represents that there is no sense of privacy in the public eye. All eyes are directed towards each and one of us where we are constantly scrutinized and judged for our actions or behaviour. Being constantly watched, we have the tendency to please others for their own happiness and their approval. We sometimes forget to be true to ourselves and lose a part of our identity. 

In life, we are judged for our actions and behaviour. The choices we make will can lead us to success, though there are times where we will stumble and fall. We must choose to get back up  and move forward. Between all the photos, the demonstrator being arrested, the stop light, and the surveillance cameras supports the theme of personal growth and as unique individuals, how we can positively contribute back to the community.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The first picture that stood out to me was the picture of the police car (row 14 in the middle). This immediately made me think of an authority theme linked with technology. When I think of jobs that have a high level of authority, I immediately think of police officers. Being a police officer is a very noble job that takes courage to pursue due to its higher level of danger but I really respect them for putting their lives on the line to try to keep our society safe and in order. one thing this picture doesn't show, is the excessive amount of technology that is set up in these cars, such as GPS, computers, and intercom but it is common sense that these types of technology would be inside the car to facilitate their job. The picture was also taken at night, reinforcing the fact that it is a 24 hour job.

On the contrary to the first picture, the picture in the middle of the first row really caught my eye. I think it represents authority, and their (sometimes) unfair way of imposing that authority over citizens. It shows two police officers appearing to use brutal force on an African-American woman who was simply just protesting for what she believed in. You can also see a group of African-Americans standing there and watching (most likely in disgust, although you cannot see their faces), which goes to show that sometimes authority will take advantage of their power to try to change your beliefs to match theirs.

Another interesting picture was the family on the skytrain who seemed so engrossed in their phones (third row on the left). The theme demonstrated here is technology, and more specifically, their apparent obsession with it. Instead of being social, and interacting together as a family, four out of six of them are staring blankly into their phones, the other two are young children who appear to be ignored by their parents/family. This shifts the dependance from family, to technology.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The three pictures I have chosen are the picture of clouds and sunshine, the picture of a green grassy field with trees and the picture of a man with a bunch of items laid out on a street in a city. The three photos cover a wide colour spectrum. One photo focuses on more of a dark grey scale while one of the other photos is visibly brighter with green and blue colours. The last photo is a combination of dark grey and a bright orange colour. The picture of the clouds with sunshine and the picture of the grassy field with the sun shining both were perceived as bright and gives off a more positive reaction. While the picture with the man (perhaps he is homeless) on a street with items laid out in the dark gave me a more of a gloomy and sad reaction. From these three pictures I can see a theme of nature with positive and negative perspectives and it could be how we perceive the world we live in  The first two pictures were taken when the sun was out and brightening up the pictures, which could be a representation that the world we live in is a bright and positive place. In the picture with a possible homeless man with items laid out on a sidewalk  could represent another side of our world. The picture was taken when it was dark outside which contributes to a gloomy and depressing feeling when looking at the picture. The picture shows a more dark side and that there is more then just sunshine and pretty grassy fields in the world we live in.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey Jessica, 
I totally agree that money and technology rules everything around us, it's rather depressing. I like how you analyzed the pictures such as the dollar bill, being a consumer truly is unavoidable especially when we live in a society where being materialistic is the norm. The cellphone analogy got to me! Families these days are so wrapped up in their own lives that they forget to enjoy it with those who truly matter. People spend too much time trying to catch up with unimportant relations.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The recurring theme I see in three pictures is the CONTROL through ART. Artists’ personalities exude from how they can naturally create pieces that control the emotions of artists themselves and as well as their audience. There are reactions that come from their audiences that have experienced their works and moved them in some kind of way.  Artistry is expressing what you feel and see or what you have seen through different forms and ways of creativity. It can be expressed through words: songs and poems, paintings, acting: movies and television shows, video games, and even graffiti. There are numerous photos in this module that correspond to this particular theme: the actor on the Global Channel show, two pictures with graffiti, and the photo of an avatar. All photos show that art can be a way to let people know what they are ought to know and be able to manipulate them in a less violent way. And although it involves no violence, it is still quite effective with deceiving the audience. As an example, the picture with the spray painted eye was so prominent in the photo.  It shows one’s sadness, perhaps problems in a person’s life or someone searching for answers among chaos that others can relate to. One would also notice the shadow of the fence that corrupts the eye of the same picture. It is comparable as to how novels like “Moxyland” and “1984” show how blind the citizens are from the manipulations of the government. They place this big barrier in front of characters’ eyes that stop them from seeing the truth and the corrupt ways of the government. Consequently, they just have to open their eyes and learn to climb that fence and overcome the government’s control and power over them. Similarly, the other graffiti photo has so much creativity in it, and also, a story that is all too familiar at the same time. It is amazing and quite insightful how ironic the picture presents itself. It is full of many bright colours, and movement (comparable/illusion of a dystopian society). The picture has that bright side to it, but the art itself can be compared to a government that just feeds its citizens with information. They don't care whether it is all false or pure truths as long as it it coming from them. Furthermore, the photo of the avatar is an expression of a computer generated character appearing to look like a person. One can appear to be someone else, and take on a new persona just like how "gamers" play in video games. Actors and actresses are asked take on a new attitude and experience something they have never felt when they are acting. Similarly, this is why famous artists make music and have passions in acting because they can show something that they normally won’t show in normal circumstances. They have total control of their own emotions, and take control of how they want their audience to feel. They can be manipulative with how they act and their interpretations in every scene. Artists know what they want, and how they want their art to be seen, making it truly effective in controlling their audience. This noticeable total control of emotions, actions, and thoughts through art is essential in the life of every artist.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Based on the pictures above, and the overwhelming amount of pictures taken of technology, it is safe to say that is the big umbrella theme represented. However technology is represented in a few different ways. One thing I noticed about a majority of the photos is that they were taken from either a bird’s eye view, or from a level distance, not so much from an ‘ants eye view’ (a view looking bottom up). This led to think that one of the themes could be pertaining to the perceived control humans have over technology. Technology and innovations are man-made, leading us to think that we have control over them, and not the other way around – however is that actually the case? Are our inventions truly making the world a ‘better’ place?
The first picture that stood out to me regarding this theme was the one of the can of Fruitopia and the open bottle of antibiotics. I picked this because innovation has allowed companies first of all, to sell a can covered in fruit with contents of juice containing on average 32g or more to consumers that will see the ‘fresh looking fruit’ on it and perceive is as something beneficial to their health. This is of course not the case and anyone that drinks Fruitopia instead of eating fresh fruit will ultimately get sick. Which is where the bottle of antibiotics come in. Technology has also given us medication to make us feel better, when the cause of illness could be attributed to technology, too.


The second picture I chose was of the family sitting down on the seats, all starring down at their phones. I laughed at the picture, even though it looks familiar to every bus or sky train ride. Technology is definitely in control in this picture because it is forcing humans to be consumed in the product during times of waiting instead of having the human’s converse with one another. 


The last picture I chose was the one of the various different cellphones, iPods, game console controllers, handheld game consoles all laid out on the ground. It showed the dominance that technology has over humans in a way that we can see the progression of technology over the years, that is, the progression of technology that we possess as younger children, to adults. The times and technology change rapidly as time goes on, which compels consumers to do the same with the devices they own. Why? Why isn’t a Blackberry Curve not a sufficient smartphone to have anymore? Why is it that people feel the need to wait 8 hours in line at Metrotown for the newest iPhone? Technology has driven us to do unimaginable things.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Wireless modem on top of an apple gadget, translink compass card tap machine, and the video game is, in my opinion, reflective of our society: free of any attachment/commitment. We are heading towards wire-free. Numerous technological companies are in a race in inventing cool gadgets and accessories free of any reliance to wires. Likewise, with the increased popularity of wire-less world, our society has slowly freed itself from any attachment to the real world. There is an increased usage of social media, virtual worlds, and many other offline medium to connect with one another. We are disconnected physically but at the same time connected by form or wireless connection.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I found that keyboard picture with the focus on control stand out as well. I think this picture beautifully demonstrates technology and suppression as themes. To build off this theme of supression, I will point to a minor theme of surveillance in the photo with the two surveillance cameras. Technology not only allows us to have access to much more information than previous generations, but it also can be used to gather information on us, whether it be by government or corporate or whoever. This can be used a tool for control (Kinda like not wanting to do something because you saw a camera there pointed at you). 

The police cruiser also adds to the theme of suppression (specifically state/government suppression through technology). The police now can also use a suspect's phone to incriminate, and some cruisers have lap-tops on the console. They can run your name in that laptop and have access to all your important information (Name, address, etc). So the benefits of technology can go both ways.

In any-other context, I would just see all the pictures of wifi-routers and gaming consoles as useless mumbo-jumbo if I was given the same context, but having read Moxyland, the technological aspect definitely was the first thing that popped into my head. I really do believe that my reading of Moxyland affected this, as I probably would of decided to focus on the just the police and/or drugs/money as a theme if I was told to do this assignment in any other context.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The theme of a police state, whereby the police are recording many aspects of peoples lives, is dominant in several of the photos. The theme is very reminiscent of George Orwell's 1984 and how "big brother is watching you". Specifically, the photo of two different cameras, angled slightly differently. This is an interesting photo because whoever took that picture probably took it this way so that the cameras couldn't record it. This may have been done subconsciously but it reflects the concerns and mistrust we have about being recorded, and how we might not want those who are monitoring the cameras to know we took a picture of it. Then, whoever took another photo of a skytrain platform seemingly didn't have such concerns about taking a picture of a camera that the camera would have or could have seen. Also, at least one of the people in the photo appear to have noticed they were getting their photo taken. This is a similar picture to the first photo I mentioned but was taken from a frontal angle, with no concern for who was aware of the picture taken. Finally, the picture of the eye is symbolic in that it represents that we are being watched and recorded all the time, whether it be by cameras, satellite images, google earth, etc.. The fact that someone spray painted close to it could very well represent our dislike for being recorded, watched, etc. 

This is a significant theme because it is relevant to us today, in Canada. For example, about a week ago, a customs agent wanted to look through a Quebec man's cell phone who was returning from vacation and he refused. Now, it will probably become a precedent setting case. Also, Harper wanting to pass bill c-51 which would intrude even more so on our privacy. Anyway, that is a little off topic a little but makes for an interesting comparison.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The photos of the demonstrator pinned down by the officers, the jumbled jigsaw pieces, and the colourful mural all represent civil unrest. 

The photo of the arrested demonstrator implies protesting against what is probably a social and/or political problem. The civilians in the background are probably a part of the group of protesters demonstrating their displeasure and/or anguish to the public or the government. Such opposition consequently brings chaos and in this case, the demonstrator’s arrest.

The photo of the puzzle pieces is similar in that the disorganized heap of pieces have ‘acted together’ to bring disorder to the completer of the puzzle. Though the pieces are inanimate, they possess the ability to cause conflict and dismay by causing the person to meticulously sort through and correctly assemble the puzzle.

The vibrant mural is an incredible clash of colours all encapsulated in one image. The disorder of hues in the illustration grabs the attention of onlookers in an unpleasant way, evoking feelings of confusion and conflict. The image voices the ideas of the artist, that seemingly oppose the common views of its audience, with its display of dramatically contrasting colours.

While there is chaos in each photo, there is the possibility of harmony too. Negotiations or compromise are likely to resolve the demonstrator’s woes, while the jigsaw reflects harmony when the pieces are united, and the mural is a piece of art when looked at from a distance. To every problem, there is a solution. It is the way the solution is reached that can cause significant disorder.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The three pictures I chose were: 
1.	The photo of the cell phone and the baton on the table. 
2.	The photo with the painted eye on the shaded transformer box. (I took that picture buts it’s a pretty great picture, if I do say so myself) 
3.	The photo with the two monsters graphited on the wall. 

          These pictures all represent the theme of rebellion against a controlling authority figure. In the first photo, the controlling authority figure is the cell phone that was created and introduced by a consumeristic government. People are constantly checking their phones even when no alerts go off.  Cell phones control the lives of any first world citizens because people are so overly dependent on their phones. A cell phone can also be a listening device by the speakerphone or the camera. By placing the baton right next to the phone, it shows a sense of fight or resentment against the phone that the government may or may not be hacking into and that so many people cannot go without. 
          The second picture is the picture of the “angry watching eye” painting on the transformer box. This photo screams rebellion against a controlling authority that closely watches and observes the citizens within its district. Someone had to of painted that symbol on the box and by grafting a transformer box that shows a sense of defiance against a nosey and controlling government. I also think that the person who painted this picture wants others so see and recognize the theme of the closely watching government and to show awareness of what people do when they think no one is watching. 
          The last photo is the two monsters graphited on the wall. The two monsters remind me of a “bate and trap” scenario. Where the bigger monster has his tentacle hanging out as the” bate” for the smaller monster to come bite it. When the smaller monster bites the bigger monster, he falls into his “trap” and the bigger monster then eats him. This could be a representation or a metaphor of a controlling government handing out “bate” to their smaller minded citizens and the citizens taking that bate; thus, falling into their trap. By this picture being graphited on the wall, it does show a symbol of rebellion and a fight against the monstrous government.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[One of the main themes that I can see by looking at all of the photos is the need of connectivity through all of our society. In the twenty-first century, one of the most prominent ways that people continue to stay connected with one another is through technology. We get caught up in our cellphones, computers, and tablets even when we are face to face with friends and family. We feel the need to be up to the minute on events and breaking news around the world and in the lives of others so we are constantly checking our newsfeed, storyboards and refreshing our updates. We often forget that we could just reach out to important people in our lives face to face where there is a deeper connection. 

The first picture that I chose which relates to this is theme is the man sitting at the table who is engaged in his phone and appears to be texting or playing a game. Probably everyone has experienced a similar situation with a friend or family. Second, the family on the skytrain who are not engaged with one another but are seemingly "glued" to their phones. When multiple human beings are forced to be in a confined public space, they often feel uncomfortable and turn to what is comfortable to them: texting and checking their social media updates. This is an alternative to facing what is actually surrounding them and not having to deal with the possibility of an awkward social interaction or brief eye contact. 

Finally, the last picture that relates to my theme of a detached society is the picture of the unconnected puzzle pieces on the floor. This relates to our relationships with one another with not exactly knowing what is going on in each others lives. Those who spend a lot of their time online believing they are engaged in intimate relationships, typically misunderstand the level of connectivity. Sometimes we find ourselves very separated from our real world surroundings and this can lead to loneliness and even depression.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The picture of the monster energy drink represents addiction. When I first saw the picture, it quickly reminded me of Kendra’s addiction to the soft drink called “Ghost”. Kendra is described as a “walking advertisement” and it can lure people into getting the drug that Kendra was injected with. It can be compared to a TV commercial for example. The intent of the commercial is to lure audiences into buying it/consuming the product and potentially make the audience to buy more of this product. Addiction could be a theme in Moxyland as we read that Kendra consume a lot of Ghost after she was injected with the nanobots. 

The picture of the large green garbage disposal with graffiti on it (which looks like an eye) can represent dystopia. Graffiti in my mind always tells me that this place is where crimes take place or vandalism. I looked up the word dystopia on Wikipedia and it tells me that it is an “imaginary community that is frightening”. This can connect to Moxyland because the tone of the story sounds unpleasant. For example, Tendeka was beaten because he rebels to the cooperation that produces nanobots and injecting them to people. He think that this cooperation corrupts Cape Town because the cooperation controls people and overpowering them with advertisements. From that,  I could see why people like Tendeka view Cape Town as a dytopia. 

The last picture is the person who using his phone. The picture seems to represent being connected to society. In Moxyland, being connected is important to be able to live in Cape Town because people use it for money, jobs and to be part of society. If a person disconnected, they would be abandoned by society and this means that person will “lose” their life because they no relationship with anybody (we are all relationships/interactions with other people so that we can function through life).]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[There is a theme of chance in these photographs. Although the subjects in the majority of the photographs are classified as high tech, there is the theme of chance because there is always the thought that the device or technology will not work. Three photos that clearly show the thought of chance is the puzzle pieces, the coin, and the red lights. These all represent the theme of chance because there is a possibility of it not working out the way that it is supposed to which can be due to the perspective that a particular individual has on it.  

The three photographs that clearly show chance are the ones that are unrelated to high tech. The puzzle pieces show chance because it takes a fair amount of time for someone to be able to find the right pieces to fit together, the probability of picking up a piece to fit another right away is really low. The coin shows chance because of the idea behind flipping a coin to decide an outcome. The red lights also present the idea of chance because the chance of coming across a red light on your journey is fairly high, especially if it is in the city. 

With all the technology as a whole and all the photographs together the theme of chance is still present because there is a chance with technology that it will not work or something will go wrong with it. There is the chance of a mistake occurring with the software, mistake of pulling the wrong cord, mistake of accidental food poisoning, chance of misunderstanding and so on.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The surveillance camera and the stop lights show surveillance by people with more power and higher authority than yourself. It also shows that people have to comply to rules in a way and makes people feel safer. There are also many photos of technology here. Not all technology in the photos are of high tech or old technology but show the diversity in technology and throughout the novel there were many instances when all sorts of technology played a role in moving the narrative forward. The stop lights and the surveillance camera both display the theme of technology at different levels. Then there is also a photo of a screen shot of a phone showing apps and what technology that younger generations use. In many of the photos you can see that our generation and society today focuses a lot on technology. It surrounds our everyday lives. There are even a few photos of other people that are all on their phones while they are with other people not communicating with each other but rather with people who aren't with us. On the other hand the photos of the people being consumed by technology could show how they are trying to stay connected with everything that is going on in the lives of others when they aren't with them. Just like in Moxyland staying connected is important in order for you to stay part of Moxyland and not becoming an outcast.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The three pictures that caught my eye were 1. The African American protester (in the first set of pictures), 2. The homeless person (in the second set of pictures) and the five dollars picture. The common theme through the three pictures is discrimination. Discrimination may be based on an individual’s race, sex, age, religion or beliefs.
In general, the African American picture is representing the theme of discrimination that is going around the ward every day, and how authorities deal with it.  The picture shows several protesters one of them women is laying on the ground refuses to move and two police officers use excessive force toward her. The police officers represent the government, and the force used represents the way used to control people. The picture reflects the racial discrimination toward African American and how the government tries to suppress protesters.  
The homeless person photo represents discrimination based on social economic status of an individual. The picture shows man setting on street looks like homeless. Most people don’t like to deal with homeless people .Because they understand that homelessness is related to mental health and addictions issues or individual problem. Most people do not choose homelessness. Instead, homelessness results from a social system which fails to catch and support people who are at risk of homelessness.
The third picture of five dollars could represent economic discrimination. Different rates of compensation for the same ability based on worker’s age, race, religion or sex.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Ready, Set, Play - Module Week 11</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Instructions:</strong> <em>Due for the March 18th class.</em> Reading <em>Ready Player One</em> is a trip through a mind-boggling assortment of cultural references--mostly to 1980s video games and pop culture. You probably understand better now why we watched <em>War Games</em> earlier in the semester. 

This module asks you to play a 1980s video game and think about a theme suggested by that game. 

<strong>Task</strong>: Seek out an online emulator and play a 1980s video game. There are a few sites and examples below, but try to seek out your own. You can use the video game references in <em>Ready Player One</em> as a guide or, simply forge out on your own and type "1980s video games" into google--add "emulator" if the return is all knowledge-based stuff (a lot of people nerd out on 1980s video games).

Once you have played the game a few times (at least 5 times, but no need to master it; unless you need to master it), write about the themes that the game puts into play or suggests through the gameplay. Another way to think about it: how would you "read" or interpret this video game? How would you make the game mean something? <strong>Please make sure to include a link to the game you played.</strong>

Here's a list of some games (<strong>DON'T PAY FOR ANY GAMES - THERE ARE PLENTY OF FREE ONES</strong>):

<a href="http://www.1980-games.com/us/old-games/nintendo/nintendo-games.php">Ready Player One</a>
<a href="http://www.1980-games.com/us/action-games/remake.php">Ready Player Two</a>
<a href="https://archive.org/details/msdos_Neuromancer_1988">Ready Player Three</a>
<a href="https://archive.org/details/atari_2600_library">Ready Player Four</a>
<a href="http://www.free80sarcade.com/">Ready Player Five</a>

<strong>Summary</strong>

What we should be getting at here is threefold: 1) the games often reflect a 1980s-based diaspora (look it up!), suggesting imminent death by aliens, atomic warfare, or otherwise--this reflects the themes of the 1980s and the concerns many had about the future; 2) the themes of the day are varied, but they all focus on loss (Mario loses his girl to Donkey Kong (and it's not even a Donkey; it's a Gorilla, how does that make any sense?), Space Invaders shows us alone in our fight to project ourselves from invasion (hello USSR metaphor!), and quests (you gotta get something or find something to survive); 3) How do the above two elements (folds?) combine in <em>Ready Player One</em>? That's to say: what is <em>Ready Player One</em> about?

Some suggested themes: Atari, Movies, 1980s cultural references, dystopia, hacker, gunter, race, religion, education, games, gameplay, literary games, biotechnology, dystopia, utopia, nanotechnology, digital technology, hierarchy, hegemony, privilege, cyberpunk, indulgence, totalitarianism, government, gender, corporation, consent, ecology, signal, control, autonomy.

<strong>Outcomes</strong>
<ul>
<li>Try to think about how you could write about the numerous cultural references in the book in a meaningful way. What do they mean?</li>
<li>How is "gaming" a theme? One that is rich with definitional possibilities--do we mean "gaming" as in "gaming the system" or cheating; or, do we mean "gaming" as a verb--to play the game? How might they be related?</li>
<li>How does the book seem to reflect a current cultural moment while also reflecting upon another one at the same time? Who's virtual world is this we're in?</li>
<li>Bring the terms we have discussed in the course to bear on your reading: is there a "resistant" way to read this novel? What are the characteristics of its dominant reader? What kind of cultural capital does one need to understand the book? If one doesn't have the capital, where does one find it?</li></ul>

<strong>Note:</strong> Remember, we're starting to wind down the course. Work on using the terms of the first half of the course (setting, character, POV, etc.) within the thematic analysis (what part and/or action of a character suggests that the 1980s were a very shallow decade?).

<strong>Final Note:</strong> There's a lot of reasons to become passionately involved in <em>Ready Player One</em> and its numerous cultural references. Here's a few items for those of you who want to go further down the rabbit hole. 
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.nerdist.com/2015/02/nerdist-book-club-ready-player-one/">The Nerdist Book Club</a> is doing a good read-along of <em>Ready Player One</em>, timing couldn't be better.</li>
<li>This a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_video_game_burial">great story about Atari</a> that has been in the news recently.</li>
</ul>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[http://my.ign.com/atari/missile-command

Missile Command represents a dystopian society, laden with turmoil and uncertainty. The main theme in this game is 1980's cultural reference to the Cold War, which suggests the possibility of American-Russian missile/nuclear warfare . This is bourne of the of context that a nation is trying to defend cities while an aircraft flying overhead is dropping bombs which aims at obliterating the defender's missile defense systems.

In connection to Ready Player One, IOI represents totalitarian government which aims at gaining control over the OASIS— representative of our society. The Easter Egg is representative of resources (oil, gold, land, fortune, etc). After reading articles about the existing crisis that was prevalent in the 1980's, I got a sense of the cultural reference within the video game I played. 

Ready Player One makes an interesting connection between the past and the current events. Wade plays this super futuristic, very technological video game which revolves around 1980's era. When I think of the world virtual world, I think of "care-free, having no sense of accountability, nonexistent" environment in which you can do virtually anything. So to go along with the question, "whose virtual world is this we're in?" I say the government. We are the government's OASIS. In virtual games, the player can manipulate and bend rules, just like the government.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Super Mushroom Mario (http://www.1980-games.com/us/action-games/flash-games/mario.php
) is a video game with a simple goal – collect a certain number of mushrooms in order to enter the castle at the end of the level. Visually, the game is designed with simplicity in mind as the setting only includes different arrangements of blocks which are used as steps, the castle at the end of the level and the mushrooms themselves, all against a blue sky background. The theme of the video game represents the obstacles one faces while achieving a certain goal. Although Super Mushroom Mario is a simple game with a simple goal, there is still a lot of room for error which could mess with Mario’s progress. Unlike other video games, there are no villains, monsters or representations of ‘evil’ trying to interfere with Mario’s attempt at collecting mushrooms. The lack of ‘evil’, in my opinion, makes Mario’s mistakes more his fault than anyone else’s which demonstrates the personal struggles one can face while achieving a goal.  
In relation to Ready Play One, Mario represents Parzival on his quest to obtain all three of the keys in order to locate and unlock the Easter Egg, or in Mario’s case, the mushrooms needed to enter the castles at the end of each level. Similar to the way Mario’s personal mistakes affect his progress, Wade’s personal circumstances (lack of money, unable to travel to other planets, relationship with Art3mis etc.) often caused problems for his avatar Parzival and his quest to find the keys. 
In terms of cultural capital, Ready Player One has far too many unfamiliar references to the 1980s era which in turn makes them difficult to comprehend. However, with the case of the Super Mushroom Mario video game, I have enough cultural capital associated with Mario-related games to know that the mushrooms that needed to be collected usually represent benefits like speed, good health or extra strength, a tidbit of information someone unfamiliar with Mario would not understand.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I played Super Mario Bros. 3 which can be found at www.tripletsandus.com/80s/80s_games/html5_supermariobrothers3.htm 

The goal of this game is to avoid many obstacles such as turtles, mushrooms and flowers that shoot at you. If you can for the most part avoid the obstacles for ten levels without running out of lives you can advance to the castle to unlock the princess but if you use all of your lives you must begin again at level one. This theme caries through many of the Mario games where Mario is typically trying to save the damsel in distress. Not only is it a theme in this 1980's video game but also in many other stories, TV shows and movies today. It is never the man that needs to be saved, it is always the woman which clearly makes a statement on our society. One could read this in a way that men are strong and noble and women are weak and require a man to save them from the troubles that life brings. The game also states that men will continue to 'jump through hoops' to save their woman.

Thinking about cultural capital regarding Super Mario Bros. 3, I can easily understand that there are certain objectives in the game and boosts such as coins and power ups that can help along the way because I played video games as a child and Mario was quite popular. Whereas in Ready Player 1, it is more complex since I didn't grow up in the eighties so some of the references do not make sense to me especially the ones relating to eighties pop culture. To find the cultural capital from the novel, one could look up unknown references in the book on the internet or talk to someone who grew up in the 1980s or someone who is knowledgeable about the era. 

To read the novel as a dominant reader, you must have a little background on the eighties era. For instance, if my grandparents read this novel they would probably read it resistantly since they grew up in the forties and are against technology and don't take an interest in new innovations such as video games and the internet.]]></wp:comment_content>

The theme present in this game is time or the struggle of keeping up with time; the purpose of this game is to beat the monsters before the time runs out. When the time runs out a ghost appears that will make you lose lives. You must destroy the monsters before the ghost arrives because after that the ghost will be chasing you until it kills your character. It represents the struggle of everyone trying to catch up to time and complete tasks before time runs out or else they fail in their goal.

In Ready Player One, all the players of the game are also fighting against time to keep up with it so that they do not fail. They need to find the Easter egg before IOI does or else they lose everything they value. So similarly to the game I played we need to complete the task before time runs out or else it will get harder to defeat the monsters (IOI). Time was especially important at the last round of the Easter egg hunt as it was the first person that could find it in the room that would ultimately win the game even if it does take three people to pass the last gate.

To read this book one needs cultural capital of the 1980’s as most of the new technology present in the novel is explained in it. However, if one does not know much about the 1980’s they will be left out of a lot of the jokes or references being made in the novel. To gain this cultural capital one simply can Google most of the references but it will take time understanding it to a level similar to someone who grew up in that era.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The game I chose is called space invaders. It essentially is shooting down a bunch of aliens who float around and who also shoot at you (your player is a tank). The further into the level you get the closer the aliens come towards your tank and their shooting rate increases. They also pick up the music in the background and sound alarms when the giant UFOS come out because they are worth the most points. 
This game obviously presents the theme of Aliens invading earth. They project that the aliens come in their UFO’s and their only goal is to destroy us. This leads to me think the theme of this could also be fear because in the 1980’s UFOS and aliens caused a lot of hysteria. There wasn’t exactly a happy feeling to this game, it was set up with a dark background with creepy music and alarms that would signal when the UFO would be flying over-head for you to shoot down. The themes of alien invasion and fear are what I get from this game because the whole objective is to shoot as many aliens as possible. They are not wanted because they are not understood. I mean who knows if they even exist right so another theme could be controversy over that- over the believers and non-believers. That’s essentially how I made this game mean something. I thought about how aliens were viewed at the time and the threat they pose even though aliens are hypothetical constructs created by people who are afraid of what other life could potentially exist. The game was made to be appealing and sort of subconsciously reinforces the idea that aliens are bad and dangerous and they should all be shot. Mostly because they threaten the future of humans and were only depicted as wanting to kill us.
The fact that this game portrays a one sided argument- that the general belief was  the aliens sole purpose was to invade and destroy earth- shows they were not thinking of other possible outcomes or that aliens may not even exist at all or want to do any of the things listed above. Maybe they wanted to coexist or just check the place out, who knows. Anyway, this point of view only shows they were acting out of fear and uncertainty of what else could live among them and their gut reaction as a culture was to shoot it down (so to speak).]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The game I played was Sonic the Hedgehog found at:
http://www.1980-games.com/us/action-games/flash-games/sonic.php
The objective of the game is for Sonic the super speedy hedgehog to make his way through the levels collecting coins and killing bad guys (monkeys, penguins, Doctor Eggman etc). Themes emerging from this video game are time and greed.

 
Time relates to the theme in the sense that Sonic is a ‘fast’ animal (although hedgehogs in real life have big bodies and small little legs which doesn’t make them ideal for running) that has to get through the different stages as quick as possible, but still collecting the coins and killing bad guys. This could be representative of people’s thoughts that the quicker something was done, the better. 
Greed is a second theme I noticed in the game, because of how Sonic collected gold coins. When you moved Sonic into a bad guy, you lost a lot of coins. This is representative of how people often don’t like to share with others, especially money or rewards, and often fear of losing it when others 
get involved.


Moreover, in Ready Player One, the members of OASIS also relate to these themes. Ironically, the hunt for the Easter Egg took years from when it first was released, and theoretically could have taken many more. But since Parzival, Aech, Art3mis, and Daito and Shoto were so determined to solve this quest in hopes of doing so before the IOI did, it was done so much sooner. Also, it was the IOI’s greed that fueled them to initiate all the Sixers in on the hunt to help increase their chances of solving the hunt sooner. 


The resistant way to read Ready Player One would be by generations prior to the 1980’s, that haven’t had a lot of exposure to computer games and virtual worlds. The dominant reading of the book would be someone that ideally grew up in the 1980’s since they would possess the cultural capital required to understand the references made. However, as someone who isn’t too familiar with the 80’s, the points the narrator was trying to get across did work due to the context they were put in (eg, Wade setting his alarm to play Wham’s “Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go” in the morning).]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I played the game Tetris, which is a puzzle solving game than involves rotating blocks of different shapes and sizes to form a horizontal line with no gaps. It requires you to make rapid decisions about how to best make the blocks fit tightly together. As the game proceeds, you have less time to think about how to best place the blocks. Also, as you advance further, random assortments of blocks appear prior to starting a new level, which makes it more difficult as well.Unlike many other games, it may actually be good for your brain to play the game of tetris. That is not my opinion but rather the opinion of people who have done research on the topic. Search "Is tetris good for you brain" or some combination thereof, and you can see various studies that seem to indicate that it may stimulate certain areas of the brain. Admittedly, some of these studies are certainly biased. Here is one study that explains why it might be good for the brain: http://thebeautifulbrain.com/2011/06/the-neuroscience-of-tetris/
 
The game of tetris, in my opinion, is somewhat reminiscent of a rubix cube. They both involve solving puzzles, but of course are different in the way you go about it. They are different in a lot of ways as well. However, they are similar in that they are both a race against the clock and make you think about how things fit together, and how to rotate them accordingly to do so. 

Tetris tests how quickly you can mentally rotate objects in your head, prior to physically doing so. Some blocks appear similar but as they are sliding down the screen they are in a horizontal position. When you go to rotate them, you can waste time if you don't immediately recognize if the "L" shaped block,or the backwards facing "L", when rotated 180 degrees, will fit appropriately in the spaces available. So in that sense it does cause you to think on your feet. As you advance you have little time to think, and it is all about reacting quickly. I think that is why this game was and/or is so popular, because it actually involves making rapid decisions and reacting accordingly. In this way, as opposed to some other games, many different people can play it since it is non-violent, involves solving puzzles, may actually stimulate your brain etc..]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I played duck hunt. It’s a game about shooting ducks, usually with a plastic gun (it was like a 1980’s wii), by aiming at the screen with your gun. You lose by not shooting a certain amount of ducks from each round and when you lose, a dog taunts you with his annoying laugh. The game cannot be beaten, even with using cheats to ‘alter your skills’ (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvYvNDFnEM8).
Though, I feel the game’s theme is skill. To prepare yourself for killing ducks, practicing rather. I find it interesting that there is no winner, even though the goal of the game is to win, or at least mine was. No matter how good someone could be, they would always lose. I find Duck Hunt to be similar to Tetris, where you can’t win. I also find resetting back to level 1 on both games when you lose interesting. Frankly because I can act more of a retard in the lower stages of the game, but find that I have more to lose in the later stages. It’s similar to ready player one, because Wade has to take precautions of the Sixers. Otherwise, he would lose all his stuff and start out as a level 1. Overall, I think this assignment is putting us in Ernest Cline’s shoes. I feel like he portrays Haliday because of the references he enjoys (I’m assuming!) inside the book. And we, the readers, are the gunters. Cline’s way of giving showing us references of what he enjoys, just as Haliday did. That, and his contest for solving the puzzle in his book—the prize being a car from back from the future. I’d imagine it would be like finding the limerick in ch. 2—find the odd letters and put them together, thus finding a clue to the puzzle. Anyways, that’s my interpretation of this assignment so far.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I played a bunch of different ones but Mario games have always been my favorite so first I played the Mario mushroom where the goal of the game is successfully collect a certain number of mushrooms to enter the castle, then I played Mario remix (http://www.1980-games.com/us/remake/mario/017.php) and the goal of this one is to get through the obstacles, like turtles, and other creatures in your way. Honestly, I played about 39 times and I couldn't get through the first round so I just got frustrated and closed the game, so I am not 100% sure of how the levels go. Since I am somewhat familiar with the Mario type games I am able to figure out what the goal is quickly, what controls to use and the sorts of level ups there are in the game. Although I am awful at the game itself I have some cultural capital since I have played it, and many other versions of the game throughout my childhood. 
The theme relates to defiance and perseverance in these games, from obstacles to your own self. You want to make the character jump or go a certain way but if you're too slow or don't know how to use the controls it is likely it won't go the way you planned. The obstacles like all the creatures will continue to stand in your way to make you fail. After failing, you start up at the beginning and continue the quest, a lot of patience is required. 
These show up in Ready Player One, going on the quest for the Halliday's egg, the patience it took to do all the thorough research on Halliday, constantly pushing through and avoiding obstacles like the sixers.  In the novel, I had little cultural capital seeing as I wasn't familiar with the games and movies that were being played or talked about (besides War Games) and so while reading the novel I think a little of all three types of reading came into play. The lack of cultural capital and understanding of the 1980's games resulted in some oppositional reading. Whereas for some parts, being able to picture the technology being used or knowing the movie War Games helped the dominant reading.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[http://www.1980-games.com/us/old-games/nintendo/s/Super_Mario_Bros_3/game.php


	One of the first games I ever bought on my Nintendo 64 was Super Mario 64. I decided to play Super Mario Brothers 3 as it reminded me of my first childhood game. The character you play as, Mario, is one of the most iconic video game characters ever created. 
Although the game play overshadows the story, Super Mario Brothers 3 still has a plot. It is presented in tidbits while the game play is exposed in a bigger fashion. Just as in other Mario games, Princess Peach needs to be rescued by Mario. Maybe the theme in Super Mario Brothers 3 could be rescuing the damsel in distress. This is the theme I feel is most represented because the plot does not show any other storyline. Furthermore, Bowser is the character holding the Princess captive and he plays an antagonistic role in the game. In Ready Player One, Wade’s main objective is to find the easter egg in the OASIS while being pursued by Sorrento. When compared together, both plots revolve around a bad character trying to cause a problem. 
	The goal of Super Mario Brothers 3 is to go from the first level to the last by beating enemies along the way. In the game, there are a few maps and the objective is to beat all the levels in each map. This will advance the player further into the game. It seems the game tries to present itself as a point A to B type of game. Beating enemies is pretty simple because all the player needs to do is hop on top of the enemy. They pose a threat to Mario’s health and this eliminates them. 
One thing I clearly noticed is how much this character, and video game series has evolved. Graphics and the power of the current generation hardware are evidence of that in the modern age. As I played the game, I noticed basic controls and the characters not having much of a back-story. Games are very complex and robust in these categories nowadays. However, their have been games where the developer completely botches the title.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[http://www.1980-games.com/us/action-games/flash-games/missile-strike.php	

	The game that I played is called Missile Strike and to play, you have to shoot rockets to save your base from being destroyed from asteroids. This game reflects the popular theme in the 80’s of nuclear warfare. The Cold War caused a huge scare of nuclear bombs so the games of that time reflect this situation. This game would be popular for kids because it is an exciting relevant issue. Children always want to act like adults so being able to become some sort of leader of an attack will appeal to them.
	Ready Player One reflects upon two different points in time that are relevant to our culture today. The setting of the novel in in a dystopia where the earth is dying and society is collapsing. This is a realistic future comparing it to the direction that society is heading towards with global warming and terrorist attacks. Despite the glim future, the book keeps a positive attitude going with OASIS. The program is gives hope to the players that they can still enjoy life despite their real troubles. The 80’s were a time of excitement as technology grew faster and people were always looking up. As time went by, the hope of society diminished so keeping the excitement of the 80’s alive is a coping mechanism for the people.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The game Street Fighter 2(http://streetfighteronline.info/) is a fighting game where the characters from different nationalities battle each other in a timed 2 round fight. The main objective of the game is to win fights.  A theme in the game is time because if your health is lower than your opponents after the time is up then you lose.This time limit creates a sense of urgency to complete a task which in this case is to beat/knockout the opponent.This relates to Reader Player One because Parzival has a time limit to find the egg and if he doesn't complete this task quickly then other Gunters might complete it before he does. Another theme in this game is patriotism/war because each character is from a different nationality it seems as if the characters are fighting for their countries. Like Ready Player One there are many different characters in the OASIS and the Characters are fighting for something. Parzival is fighting against the Sixers of the IOI because the Sixers are after him while Art3mis is trying to find the egg so she can do a good deed and help end world hunger. 
There were few references that I understood in Ready Player One because I didn’t grow up in the 80’s and don't the cultural capital. But after completing this module I could see some games that were referenced in the book and I even tried a couple of them. To my cultural culture I can say the Oasis in Ready Player One is similar to the internet. You can be or do anything in the Oasis, like Parzival going to school and learning. The way we use our internet is similar as we use the internet to google everything. Also in our internet we “technically” can be a character and live in a virtual world.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[http://www.tripletsandus.com/80s/80s_games/html5_galaga.htm 

The (fantastically frustrating) game, Galaga, suggests that people should be prepared to face death. Players are given 3 lives for a reason- so they can play twice more when they die! Death is imminent. Galaga certainly proposes that death can happen at any time and we can’t always predict when it will occur to us. The invading enemy aliens shoot at you and sometimes swarm you, killing you from behind. Because of the enemy’s clear death threat, you always have to be on guard, prepared to defend your spaceship by shooting the enemies down. There is a lot of emphasis on being ‘quick on your feet’ to protect yourself and kill the enemy. Galaga is probably responsible for training David Lightman, from WarGames, to be quick witted in every situation. In a way, Galaga has prepared David to take down Joshua/WOPR.

Like players of Galaga, Parzival is constantly in danger of being killed thus he must always be ready to protect himself, especially from sixers. Just like Galaga ‘trained’ David Lightman, all the 80s culture research prepares Wade to find the Easter egg and his own sharp wits allow him to go further on the hunt. Galaga and all Wade’s 80s research overall suggests that people should prepared to defend themselves, whether its with weapons or knowledge, or be prepared to die…]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I played the game pacman. The goal of the game is to eat all the pellets on the screen before getting tagged by a ghost. The ghost is able to capture or stop pacman by touching or tagging him. It is like a game of tag between pacman and the ghosts. If the pacman is able to eat a fruit, then the rolls of the ghosts and the pacman are temporarily reversed and the pacman is now trying to eat the ghosts. 

The pacman game relates to Ready Player One in the way that the ghosts in pacman are trying to prevent pacman from moving on to the next level just as the IOI employees are trying to prevent Wade and the other players to moving on to the next level. The IOI employees are trying to get possession of all the keys so that the players cannot win, however they do not know how to unlock the next level or gate. The ghosts in pacman are trying to prevent pacman from eating all the pellets which has no use to the ghosts because they do not know how to, or serve the purpose to unlock the next level.

Some of the references in the Ready Player One novel were confusing to me because I did not grow up in the same time frame as the setting in the book. The book takes place more into the 1980’s. The references to their popular culture was different compared to the very different culture that we have today.

The theme I picked out of the pacman game was more like the survival of the fittest rather than obstacles to be overcome. The goal of the game is basically to stay alive. As soon as you get “tagged” in the pacman game, you lose all of the progress that you made with eating the pellets and have to begin back at the beginning.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I played contra, found at http://www.1980-games.com/us/action-games/remake/contra.php

I played contra before, when I was much younger and I had a rough idea of what it was about gameplay wise.What struck me as odd was that some of the graphics looked as if they were added with a modern flash animator 
(the ship in the intro, plus the sparkles in the starting menu). The emulator also added a CPU monitor, infinite lives, and a cheat-menu for weapons. Contra, although the core of it is the same on this emulator, has lost the level of challenge that I remember it having (although I slightly expected it to be altered after seeing the sparkles at the start menu).

However, I was able to notice something about the theme that the poorly made plot was presenting. Two Marines (A branch of the US Navy) are fighting the Red falcon (Red, being the USSR reference). I decided to wikipedia the story-line of contra, reading that the Red Falcon alien invaders are stationed in the  Galuga archipelago, New zealand. Again, the USSR had their work-camps nicknamed the Gulag-Archipelago (Referring to the gulags spread throughout Siberia) and this struck me as a second reference to the USSR. The alien invaders crash into earth, remain dormant for 2 years, and then abruptly unleash Armageddon on humanity (referencing the USSRs capability to unleash a nuclear war). The metaphor to the USSR is complete with the soldiers themselves: the enemies are literally a red army. The red falcon represents the lost security in the cold war-era, where the threat of nuclear war hung over everybody's head.

In Ready Player One, Wade speaks out about the injustices in the real world that is plagued with poverty, unemployment and war. In Wade's world, the threat that hangs over their head is the loss of security as-well due to the semi-disastrous conditions the world was in. In the prologue, the narrator talks about Major Cities being nuked. Wade's thought also present a theme of isolation in the early chapters (He spends his free time in OASIS, interacting with people online rather than in person, was raised on OASIS, he lost his parents, his mother was an E-escort). The theme of catastrophe that is present in the 80s video games, is also present in Wade's world. Video games are used in both instances as a sort of 'snap shot' of the era. In the 80s, the theme of loss was common in gaming, fighting off a relentless enemy bent on bringing about world domination. Similarly, Wade's world is filled with the same threat of the world coming undone but the threat I extracted was that Wade saw humanity as the sole cause of it. The video game Wade plays shows a utopia, a haven from the grim real world (Just like how a real oasis is a haven from the brutal conditions of a desert).]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I played a 1980’s video game called Frogger. The theme of Frogger is to get the 5 frogs from one side of the street to the other one at a time. But to do so, the frog must successfully leap through a 5 lane highway without getting hit by any cars, then it must successfully leap through a river by timing its jumps to land on the moving lilypads and logs which will sink if you take too long. The next step is to time your jump so that you land in one of the 5 sockets at the end. Sound easy? Well it’s not because you only have 3 lives and a time limit.
 I used to play this game occasionally in grade 4 at my elementary school but I was never able to beat it. Even after trying it ten times or so recently, I still could not beat it. Although I am making this game out to seem difficult, I grew up without video games, so for someone who grew up playing video games it might potentially be easier.
 This game represents to me the theme of a quest. The frog is in a race to survive, if the frog is too slow he will die, so he must be quick to survive and timing is key. This is similar to Ready Player One, Wade must be quick and well timed to succeed in his quest to decipher Halliday’s riddles in order to outperform any competitors. However, Wade has a clear meaning for embarking on his quest, whereas the frog does not. Therefore, to make the game Frogger actually mean something on a higher level than just an eighties arcade game, I would add a backstory, perhaps a short animated video at the beginning that explains to the player how the frog came to be in that situation, and a more specific motivation for strategically crossing the street. Currently the reason appears to be “so that it doesn’t die”, which is too vague.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[http://www.1980-games.com/us/action-games/flash-games/frogger.php

The game I chose was Frogger. This is a classic video game from the 1980’s that also appears in one of my favourite Seinfeld episodes. The game is very challenging but addicting and it takes dedication to master and get a score like George Constanza got. The objective of the game is to make the frog cross the road and lake to the grass while dodging the obstacles such as cars, bikes, and trucks. 

Frogger like Ready Player One both involve people blocking the main character (Frogger or Wade) from getting to the “finish”. The Frog must dodge all the hazards and obstacles while Wade is faced with Sorrento and his Innovative Online Industries members preventing him from finding the “egg”. 

Themes I see with Frogger is dystopia in the frog’s society as there are many things going on that are undesirable and frightening as one wrong movement could lead to the frog being splattered. With Wade and his quest to find the egg we can also see the dystopian society in Ready Player with both the game OASIS and also with the sixers of the IOI and how they created many frightening situations in Wade’s real life.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[http://www.1980-games.com/us/action-games/flash-games/sonic.php  

I played the game Sonic for a ridiculous amount of time. The point of Sonic was to collect as many rings as you possibly could before running to the end of the course. Of course you were being timed but it was just a timer that went up instead of down, it never “timed out” opposite of what most games are like. In this game you got to choose from about 4 different characters, each always had 3 lives. 

The theme was difficult to pick out. It’s clear that you need something to survive, not just in Sonic but also in any of the games (I played multiple). You need something in order to live and move on to the next level. However, if you don’t succeed you will not move on. In Sonic if you hit a bee, crab, money, or spikes you lost all the rings you collected, so there’s always a chance that you need to reset just as in Ready Player One and the War Games movie we watched. 

A theme the game exemplifies not only just in the video game but playing it (relates to reality too) I noticed I was very greedy. Every time I died I would just play again trying to beat the level and collect as much gold rings as I could, and whenever I hit something and lost everything I had I was so frustrated. But it also took a lot of patience, a theme that shows up in Ready Player One, when they try to hunt for Halliday’s egg.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I gave Neuromancer a few tries. I haven't played many oldschool rpg type games so even getting the controls was pretty frustrating (for example- forgetting that they didn't use mouse controls very much, it's very keyboard focused), but the point of the game seems to be to not get arrested and/or killed, upgrade your "deck" and yourself with skill chips and hopefully find some people who have gone missing. I haven't gotten too far yet because I keep getting arrested and fined. 
This game gives me a really big Blade Runner vibe. Neuromancer definitely has a dystopian hacker focused society, with some biotech, and religion based around the game Pong. It is similar to Ready Player One in this way... The "religion" rather than Pong, is the hunt for the easter egg in RPO and almost everyone is involved in the OASIS on some level, but there are the few gunters/hackers who try to find the hidden gems of information and game the system to their advantage. 
I'd say that "gaming" in the sense of "gaming the system" and as the act of playing a game pretty much go hand in hand. The limits of the rules in a game are always being tested by the players. Some players are content to remain within the rules, but others are more concerned with winning a game no matter what the rules, as long as they aren't caught or there are acceptable risks involved. As long as there have been games, I'm sure there have always been the honest and dishonest players.
I'm not sure whether you are speaking literally (outside the context of the book) or within the limits of Ready Player One when you ask "Who's virtual world is this we're in?"... in the book it could be the world of Parzival/Wade, which is within the virtual world of OASIS which is in turn the virtual world of Halliday/Anorak and Og. A lot of layers of reality. If we're also including the world that contains the book, it gets kind of fuzzy and probably totally irrelevant, I'm sorry. 

I bet there is a "resistant" way to read this book, but I can't think of how that would be because I'm pretty firmly in what is probably the dominant reading of Ready Player One. I think the easiest way to access the dominant reading is to have lived through the 80s or at least the 90s and have had a connection to the nerdy side of our culture even if you weren't directly involved in it. If someone didn't have the cultural capital to read this book, a great place would be youtube or wikipedia... there are tons of channels on youtube that have 80's era game reviews and a lot of original content inspired by the 80's.

I think the 80's seem to be a shallow decade because the movies and media I've seen is pretty taken up with youth and innocence, contrasting with the state of politics and the cold war. They were trying to emulate a simpler time to escape from what was really happening around them.

I always get really lost when it comes to thematic analysis, so I hope I at least hit something within the ballpark]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[http://www.tripletsandus.com/80s/80s_games/html5_DonkeyKong.htm#play

The game I played was Donkey Kong. Basically all you have to do is make your way to the top of a ramp by climbing up ladders and jumping over barrels that are being thrown at you by Donkey Kong. If you succeed at making it to the top you rescue Princess Peach and move on to the next level. 

I believe that the theme of this game was heroism. Mario is working his way through trying to dodge the barrels being thrown at him to save the captured Princess. If Mario gets hit by a barrel or rolled over by one he dies. As the levels increase in difficulty you need to then jump from one platform from another increasing the chances of dying. It takes a hero to face all these challenges just to save the Princess. 

In relation to Ready Player One you could say that the theme of hierarchy is also seen through out the game. You have the Princess who has been captured, which is the top of the chain, then there is Mario who is one step below, who is trying to save the princess, sort of like the soldiers or knights in a castle and then there is Donkey Kong who is at the bottom of the chain and is the evil villain.
When it comes to cultural references from the book Ready Player One, it references many things from the 1980's era that may not be as easily picked up on unless you are familiar with games or terms from that era.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The game I played was Galaga it’s a space shooting game found at: 
 http://www.1980-games.com/us/remake/space-invaders/039.php 
The main goal of the game is to destroy the aliens coming on screen. I played the game many times but couldn’t go more than level one. The player have to be fast, by moving the spaceship left and wright to brevets alien’s hits. To collects points player have to keep shooting to destroy the enemies (aliens).   I saw a video about this game, it’s showing that this game has many levels and in higher level player can double the firepower. I believe higher levels will be harder to reach. The game ends when the last player’s spaceship destroys.
The theme of this game is defensive to protect self and ground and maybe control. In relation to Ready Player One the theme of self defense is there as Wade Watts tries to define himself from IOI. Also, Art3mis think to save the earth if she wins the ester egg by helping poor people and try to end starvation. The spaceship reminds me of aliens (in old movies) who try to control the earth recourses. The same as IOI they try to control the OASIS. 
If the reader aware about the 80s capital culture, it will be much easier and more fun to read this novel. The story took place on 2044 but it’s evolve around 80s pop culture. While I’m reading the novel, I Google some names or games which mentioned to help to me understand better.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[http://www.1980-games.com/us/old-games/nintendo/t/Tetris/game.php

The video game I played is Tetris. The task is to rotate blocks of various shapes (but same size because they all have four cubes) and form a horizontal line without gaps. It gets harder when the blocks fall down quicker, forcing the player to think rapidly on forming the horizontal lines. The theme of Tetris represents how one is able to successfully solve the puzzle (horizontal line) in a given time. Also the game requires players to use their thinking to solve the puzzle in a short amount of time.
Since time management is a theme in Tetris, the game relates to Ready Player One because the main character Parzival is trying to unlock the third gate and finding the secret egg before the Sixers. Moreover in relation to problem solving in Tetris, this reminded me when Parzival/ Wade escape from the IOI after he was captured and hacked into their database to find all the information about him, Art3mis, Aech and Shoto before IOI captures all of them. This situation pressures Wade just like the game of Tetris pressures gamers as the game gets harder.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The game called Galaga from 1981 found at http://www.free80sarcade.com/galaga.php is a space game where there are enemy ships trying to attack your player. The game reflects the style of the 1980’s and possesses the colours and the pixilation of the software of the time. The game is based on a high technology based galaxy and reflects the theme of invasion by alien forces. This game focuses on the loss of a battle to survive against forces that are unknown to us and only known to be a threat.  

This combines into Ready Player one in the way that there is the ability to reset to the original status and there is the ability to try again in a variance of ways. This theme of gaming ties the novel to the games in the way that it is a learning adventure in the way that once you have tried one way of doing something and it doesn’t work there is another way to try it. Therefore there is a way to accomplish a set goal by a task of trial and error, where in the end it can be reset.]]></wp:comment_content>

The game of choice was M*A*S*H, a field hospital for the war with 5 separate choices of game styles, 3 of which are retrieval of men from the field and returning them to base while avoiding being shot by an enemy tank as well as beating the opponent (computer). The other two are identical to operation only its computer based and pixelated. The theme is surrounding war, but not the gory heroic war of a single Rambo taking down an entire enemy squad with only a paper clip, but more towards the fight behind the scenes. The race against the opponent relates to the race against time, and at some points in the game you miss men that you just can’t pick up. This would have been a reality in war that some soldiers got left behind. Without knowing that M*A*S*H was related to war hospitals from watching M*A*S*H 4077 on TV I probably wouldn’t have chosen this game because out of context M*A*S*H could mean anything. The previous knowledge I have due to my cultural background allowed me to play the game and understand what was going on (after a few mishaps discovering how to use an online emulator) without having to read instructions or google an answer. Majority of the games chosen by other classmates probably have something to do with their cultural history as well, which I find quite intriguing after reading which games chosen. Majority of them I have heard of and have a faint Idea of what the general gist of the game is but others I haven’t the faintest idea about.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The game that I played was Pac-Man which can be found at: http://www.tripletsandus.com/80s/80s_games/arcade.htm 

The goal of the game is to control Pac-Man through a maze and eat pac-dots. Pac-man has four enemies (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde) that try to catch him while trying to obtain the pac-dots. Once all the pac-dots have been eaten, you begin a new level which is more difficult and challenging then the previous level. If one of the ghost touches Pac-Man, a life is lost and Pac-Man dies. There are a total of three lives throughout the game, if all life chances have been used, the game ends. 

In every corner of the maze, there are four larger dots that temporarily give pac-man the ability to eat his enemies. When Pac-Man eats one of the larger dots, his enemies turn into a deep blue colour and reverse the direction they are going, moving in a slower pace. When an enemy is eaten, they return to their normal color and reappear to to the centre box and begin to hunt down pac-Man. 

The theme that relates to the novel Player One was in a virtual game, you have life chances that allow you a second chance to restart from the beginning to succeed moving onto the next level. In Pac-Man and in the novel Player One, you have up to three lives and then the game ends. In life, we don’t have a reset button where we can undo the mistakes we’ve made or forget where we have failed, instead we have to choose to get back up where we fell and continue on of our journey. From playing pac-man and reading Player One, I was reminded of how we are in a journey to find our own prize and succeed. People are constantly in a race to out win the other players, and if you fall behind it feels as if reaching the end of the tunnel feels impossible.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The game I chose to play was "Venture" , the goal is to guide your character named Winky to defeat monsters and collect as many rewards as you can. There are many levels (3) where it gets harder with increasing speed of the monsters.  I only made it to level 2 because I am a rookie, even with multiple tries. The theme is about perseverance and exploration of your surroundings in order to advance. There are many obstacles in the way where you have to keep trying to keep your focus and keep your eyes on the treasure. I made it into the "Two headed room", if you picked up a treasure, a monster with two heads will appear in hopes of ruining your chances of victory.The  IOI employees in "Ready Player One" were like "the monsters", with their intentions of making you lose.  The objective reminded me of Wade and his colleagues drive with locating the Easter Egg. 

Just like Winky, Wade has to be better and quicker than his opponent to complete his quest with drive to win the egg. Exploration of your surrounding will always benefit you, and never fail because it's best to know your field and what you're playing for (egg, treasure). When I was playing the game I noticed the pattern of the monsters moving and took advantage of Winky's surrounding in order to guide myself through the doors.

So, its appropriate that we now move into some creative critical practice: designing an essay profile.

This module asks you to create a profile for your essay the same way you would create a profile on The Facebook, The Twitters, The Instgram, or The Ello, or some other The Social Network.

<strong>Task</strong>: After choosing one of <a href="http://digitalcultureslab.ca/hybrid1102/essay-2/">the essay questions</a>, create a profile for your essay and post that profile in the comment space below.

You should concentrate on three main attributes:

<ul>
<li>Name (the title of your paper):</li>
<li>No more than 150 words describing the essay--the "bio" part of most social media profile sections. Tell us a little about the paper</li>
<li>Describe two main subjects your paper might cover</li></ul>

<strong>Summary</strong>

You're not beholden to anything you write down here. The module is just trying to get you thinking about or conceptualizing what you will write about. The idea here is not to come up with something definitive. The idea is to come up with a profile for your paper; something you can look at and try to imagine fully formed. Doing so will tell you what kind of paper you have and whether or not the paper is really about something of interest to you--and me!

<strong>Outcomes</strong>
<ul>
<li>Thinking about essay writing as if you were creating a social media profile should reveal more about how you are structuring your argument/approach to the subject at hand. Like social media profiles, essay profiles can reveal certain idiosyncrasies that can be great or they can be disastrous. The trick is being able to "read into" your profile and extract the good stuff, mould your essay's personality.</li>
<li>Profiles often force us to be succinct where we are often discursive (look it up!). Coming up with an effective essay profile means doing some refining and defining, something every good complete essay needs.</li>
<li>Understanding the "likes" that you have for your essay subject at an early stage can help you avoid writing about something you have no interest in and which, as a result of your disinterest, isn't sustainable as an essay subject.</li>
<li>Writing a profile is a good way of thinking about your essay's "logos," "pathos," and "ethos." It also reveals the category of analysis you will be relying on. All of which makes your essay easier to write when the time comes to add some depth to your profile.</li></ul>

<strong>Note:</strong> Remember, we're starting to wind down the course. Work on using the terms of the first half of the course (setting, character, POV, etc.) in the articulation of your profile.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Mutated Weapons
A little about the paper: 
The totalitarian government uses extreme force and new kinds of weapons that threaten the lives of anyone who steps out of line in Moxyland. New hybrid police dogs, Aitos, that attack on command more viciously than ever roam the streets instilling fear into the homeless and anyone who breaks the law. Bombs that contain not gun powder but a strain of a virus that without treatment are fatal are dropped on the masses who rebel against the government without hesitation.  As awful as these sound, perhaps the most disturbing of all the weapons are what the people cherish most; their cellphones. People cannot function without them. They are connected to everything that is essential in daily life like money supply, access to their homes and identity. How is this a weapon you might ask? Not only does it deliver an electric shock as a punishment if the police think it’s necessary, but authorities can “disconnect” a person from their cell phone at any time. Cutting them off from society, from everything important and necessary to survive. This is the most disturbing because it is said to be a worse punishment than jail to the people living in this society. These people are so reliant on their cellphones that they would rather be dead than disconnected from them. The way that weapons have been modified is significant because it projects the possibility of a future that our own generation could be heading towards.  
Two main subjects this paper may cover include:
a)	How the weapons have been modified to suit the society that they control and the reason they have more power than any machine gun or traditional use of force ever could. 
b)	Why it’s disturbing and what it implies for the future of our generation and its cell phone addiction]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thematic Element: Friendship (in Ready Player One)

The name of people would be about Friendship and the title of my paper would (something) be: How Friendship Should Be Online (may have to change it when I’m done my essay). 

In Ready Player One, the citizens use OASIS as a way to conceal their true identity and showcase their false identity to other people. People want their peers to see them what they want them to see, regardless who they truly are. OASIS gives the opportunity for people to create their “perfect” version of themselves by using avatars. In the OASIS world, Parzival has shown trust in relationships with other gunters while searching for the Easter egg. At the end, trust is essential to unlock the third gate because it needed three crystal keys. The text has relevance for Friendship because Parzival, has shown trust with Aech, Art3mis and Shoto, even though when they never met in real life and trusting their avatars as who they really are in real life. I think true friendship is the key in searching for the easter egg and surprisingly Parzival achieved those relationships, especially when everyone refuse to reveal their true identity. 

For my two main subjects I want to cover more on Parzival’s character development and how his relationships with other gunters help him winning the OASIS game because of his trust and willing to take risk to believe other people (regardless of other gunter’s avatar). Second subject would be the setting of the story and how it abuses living condition of citizens and lead to options that would ruin relationships with other people. By “ruining relationships”, I mean that citizens are living in a virtual utopian world (OASIS game) so they could hide their problems and be in relationships where it isn’t necessary to reveal their true selves. They can deceive other people by showcasing their ideal self. Some people who are using OASIS are abusing technology to make them “forget” the dystopian world they live in.]]></wp:comment_content>

About the paper…
	In Ready Player One Wade dedicates 5 years of his life to find just the first key in search for the Easter egg. After that along with help from his online friends he was able to discover the other 3 hidden keys. Many odds were against them to not continue but they just kept pushing through trying to find the keys. IOI offered Wade the opportunity to work for them but when he declines they threaten to hurt his friends and family. They end up killing everyone in the “stacks” even though everyone there was innocent. Wade doesn’t let that affect him and perseveres to try and find the keys and not allow IOI to take over the game. 
Main Topics…
	The amount of time Wade and his friends dedicate to finding the key when most people had already given up.
	With all odds against them they still perseveres to finish the hunt for The Easter egg.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[An Abundance of Technology:
This quality piece of writing will include the overwhelming dependency the characters in Ready Player One have on technology. Whether OASIS is used for recreational, educational, business purposes the characters all rely on a fantasy world to get through the day. Each day spent in a fictional utopia, is another day they lose sight of reality.
Two possible topics:
How technology has impacted, and influenced characters lives and how it will continue to affect these lives if technology proceeds to gain control where there is no longer a distinction between fictional and reality.]]></wp:comment_content>

In JPod, digital culture and computer competency is widely sought after as one of the setting takes place in a video game company. Technology connects us, something as small a "Y2K" computer glitch brought people together in an office whose name starts with a "J". The setting is a cave-like haven even though it is referred to as a "basement office", far from contact with others as everyone in the novel is so wrapped up in technology. The main character is  Ethan Jarlewski whose mother kills another character named Tim in an act to defend herself in the first chapter while he was talking on the phone. The accidental murder suggests foreshadow that technology will eventually kill us in a metaphorical sense as it can rob people their of attention span, daily social interactions, and culture.The game created by the Jpod staff represents a world of digital culture as one of the main idea is to have a consequence free environment where players can do anything without any real punishment. The new marketing director, Steven Lefkowitz, suggests a turtle to be put into "Board X". To justify this suggestion, Steven tries to persuade the Jpod staff that children will find comfort and share laughs and sorrows with a fictional character. Implying that children nowadays spend more time with games than actual friends. 

Possible Topics: 
Digital Culture is a mere Utopian created by humans &gt; suggesting that people find comfort  and safety in technology. 

Why we are so dependent on digital culture &gt; possibly talk about humans natural dependency and how we are oblivious.]]></wp:comment_content>

Thematic Element: Technology

In Moxyland, there is a huge reliance on having a cell phone and a SIM card. These are essential in human survival as it contains the personal information for the citizens. Accessing cell phones allows people to have access to their money, jobs, and homes. It is used to survive in society. However, the government also uses it as a form of punishment. For example, if a person committed a crime they would be “disconnected.” This means that they would not have access to communication, transportation or from food and water. This reliance on cell phones helps the government maintain control over the population. 


Two main subjects:

Human dependency on cell phones in real life compared to the actual survival based on cell phones in the book

How the government is using this form of technology to control the population]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Friendship from Within
In the novel Ready Player One, Wade’s relationships with the people closest to him often come in the form of friendship. Whether it’s with Art3mis, Aech, Shoto or Daito, Wade exhibits care towards these individuals and considers them as friends as well as allies. Especially when given the example of Aech, Wade had no idea who his best friend was considering Aech was a ‘she’ and not a ‘he’. Similarly, Art3mis had a physical feature she was not confident with but Wade did not consider it a big deal. Regardless, these examples prove how Wade formed friendships based on the inner personalities of these individuals and not their physical appearance. 
One topic my paper might cover is the importance of teamwork in friendship and how it ultimately lead Wade/Parzival to the discovery of the Easter Egg. 
Another topic that my paper might cover is the lack of prejudice in the friendships Wade had with his friends, especially Aech and Atr3mis, and how they formed bonds based on personality and not physical appearance.]]></wp:comment_content>

In Ready Player One the novel portrays a theme of large corporations (e.g. IOI) versus the people (e.g. Parzival, Aech, art3mis, Shoto/Daito). Innovative Online Industries is a huge multinational corporation that aims to take over the OASIS with the intent of making profit. Nolan Sorrento, the head of IOI leads the company in their pursuit of the Easter egg with strategies that include violent acts, both in the OASIS and in the real world. With IOI being a huge internet service provider corporation, they have the means and the resources that can be advantageous in reaching their end goal. Wade and his fellow gunters are aware of the corporation’s intention and battle the IOI even though they don’t have luxury of resources and means of the IOI. Not wanting the OASIS to fall in the hands of the IOI. Parzival and fellow gunters continue their quest to find the Easter egg by their own means and eventually Parzival succeeds. 

Two main subjects the paper may cover include:
1)	Comparing and contrasting the intention of the corporation versus the people in the hunt for the Easter Egg
2)	Comparing and contrasting the strategies and resources used by the corporation versus the people]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Title: Relationships on the Road to Success

Thematic Element: Relationships

Book: Ready Player One

Plot
In Ready Player One, Wade has the same goal as all of the other main characters, to be the first to find Halliday’s Egg and therefore receive Halliday’s full inheritance, which includes a fortune, and control of the game Oasis.

Setting
However, this can only be done in the virtual world of Oasis where your identity is anonymous and Wade is known as Parzival.
Wade spends more of his time in Oasis then he spends out of it, as he dreads his reality, as a lonely orphan.

Relationships
On the contrary, he has friends in the Oasis and quickly rises to fame as he becomes the first gunter to find the first key which put him up at the top of the scoreboard for the quest to find the egg.
Nevertheless, the quest gets far more difficult and that is where the significance of relationships arise.

Main Subjects:

1. Parzival could not have successfully completed the quest to find Halliday’s Egg without the                               	contributed capital from his friends, Art3mis, Aech, and Shoto.
2. Parzival was eventually able to enhance his reality outside of Oasis by bringing the best part 		of his virtual life, Art3mis, into his real life as Wade.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thematic Element: Gender
In Ready Player One, gender is theme that is present throughout the entire novel. It is represented first through Art3mis as she is the only female character present throughout most of the novel. She is the only character that the reader can get a perspective on how a female character is in the OASIS. Most of the players portrayed in the novel are males, which may show a different how gender is viewed in the OASIS. This is not clearly understood until it is revealed that Aech is a girl in real life. Then it is shown the conflict of what a women may face in the OASIS, this gives the novel two different perspectives about how women are portrayed in the game. Furthermore, even after discovering that Aech is a girl, Parzival does not treat her/him any differently since he is demonstrating how Aech’s sexuality is not based on his gender. Overall, the book had only Art3mis to show how female gender is present in the novel, until Aech is revealed to be a female, which changes most of those views. So gender is present in the novel by comparing and contrasting Art3mis and Aech’s characters.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Title: Virtuality Brought to Life

Book: Ready Player 1

Thematic Element: Communication

Bio: My essay will discuss the virtual friendships Wade has with Art3mis, Aech and Shoto, how they change when they meet face to face and how they communicate overall. The benefit of being logged into the OASIS is that one does not have to show their true self. They have the ability to create a beautiful avatar who may look nothing like their actual self. One can also easily cover up any insecurities and forget about reality. In Wade's case, he is a lonely orphan who is having troubles finding a place to fit in. Do these kind of friendships have the ability to share a deep connection? Or was it only when the friends all came together in the end that they really bonded?

Topics: 
The dynamic between Wade and Aech when Wade finds out Aech is a girl. Wade surprisingly continues to treat Aech the same and accepts the fact that Aech has lied to him all of this time.  
Wade's openness with his friends even though they have never met in person. He takes a risk by trusting them with some of his dark secrets and relies on them for advice. 
Wade's relationship with Haliday.]]></wp:comment_content>

Bio: The paper I am planning to write is answering essay question one using Ready Player One and how Wade’s escapes his real life is in a dystopian society to one where he is in a online virtual utopian society. The OASIS is a utopian society that Wade goes to to escape from the problems of real life. Like many others in the world of 2045 people escape the world of poverty and danger to enter the highly desirable almost perfect world in OASIS.  Ready Player One text portrays and comments on the thematic elements of Dystopia and Utopia. The book shows how significant Dystopia is presented through the text. We can see how even the idyll world of OASIS still conflicts with the real worlds dystopia as the IOI attempting to murder Wade in real life.

Two main subjects
1. How the two different societies (Earth, OASIS) impact Wade’s life and relationships with others.
2. The connection and contrasts between Earth’s Dystopian society and the OASIS’s utopian society.]]></wp:comment_content>

Topic: Cultural reference

	There is a natural tendency for humans to look forward rather than look back and appreciate the wonders we have created. Often times, yesterday is regarded as bad and today is better when in reality, today is just as bad as yesterday, the only difference is the type of crisis each time has. In Ready Player One, Wade has immersed himself essentially in the world of his hero, James Halliday. Based on the way and tone he narrates the story, Wade seems to praise and show interest in the 1980's. Wade's interest in 1980's games, movies, and television shows grew as he persevered in solving the puzzle in the OASIS. In addition, even though a lot of the context in the book refer to the cultural reference of the 1980's crisis of the possibility of nuclear war, there is not any hint of fear, but only a joyful era. Wade's interest in the 1980's is possibly a result of the restricted freedom he enjoys due to the economic meltdown of his generation, as compared to the 1980's when people were lively and the economy was good, at least according to Wade.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Title: Knowledge is Power

Bio: In Ready Player One, knowledge of 80’s culture is proven to be invaluable in the search for Halliday’s Easter egg. My essay will explore how Ready Player One portrays the study of 80’s culture as a means of education. Like every gunter, Wade is a student of all things 1980s and he uses his education to pass ‘the test’ of finding the Easter egg. 

Subjects covered: 
How knowledge can be a catalyst for opportunity. By furthering his learning, Parzival is able to discover new things, move forward in the hunt and gain the ultimate reward, which opens a floodgate of opportunities to better his life as Wade, in the real world.
The importance of the audience understanding references to 80’s movies, video games and consoles, books, and music. How intertextuality allows readers to connect to the excitement of moving forward both in the hunt and the book. Readers can also recognize how their personal knowledge of 80’s culture is just one example of how education connects them to the world and people around them.]]></wp:comment_content>

I haven't quite figured out what I want to write about yet hence the very generalized essay profile but your comments are helping me narrow down a topic that may interest me, thank you!!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Title: Dis(connected) escapism

About: Wade never really fit in the "real world" - in highschool he wasn't popular and he jumped at the opportunity to escape real-world school for virtual school. Oasis is wade's metaphorical oasis in the baren, harsh, reality that he lives in. In the context of a society falling apart, the Oasis represents a universal appeal to everyone: purpose and identity (or lack thereof).

Topics covered:
The easter egg - it was what justified the seemingly odd obsession Wade had with 80s culture and virtual reality. Being a 'gunter' was part of who Wade identified as, he wasn't Wade in Oasis, he was Parzival, the famous easter-egg hunter. The hunt for the easter egg wasn't just for the money - it really seemed to be part of Wade's identity. When Art3mis and Sorrento threatened to beat him to the easter egg, it shook Wade to his core - to the point where he 'snapped out' of the funk he was in. The Easter egg in Ready Player One represents a sort of 'salvation', a purpose behind the anti-social character that is Wade.  Ready Player One paints escapism with a purpose - a stark contrast from reality.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Title: What is Life Without Technology?

In my paper I’m going to discuss the relevance of technology in Ready Player One (or Moxyland, still undecided). I want to emphasize on how Ready Player One/Moxyland represents technology. Yes, I know “technology” is a huge word, so I’m going to look at the subsets that help define the theme of technology (one of many) in R.P.O/Moxyland and look at what they signal. When looking at the subsets in the book, I want to look at one specific device, whether it’s a cellphone, the Internet, or a video game, or how it affects one person.
Two possible topics:
How Ready Player One/Moxyland represents  ______________ (ex. Cell phones &gt; communication, information source, security, connectivity) and inhibits our communication.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[It’s A Man’s World 

	Ready player one portrays women as being unknowledgeable and negative influences toward success. The female roles in this novel were very minimal and the included female characters were not shown as being strong individual characters.

	Art3mis seemed to be an independent character but as the story progressed, her independence depleted. She became just the love interest in the story that just provided drama that helped the narrative move forward. Instead of just being a competitive friend, she had to be a crush of Wade.
	
	Aech did have a strong character that had her own intelligence that didn’t rely on others but there was a catch. It wasn’t okay for her to be heterosexual, she had to be homosexual as if people with male traits will succeed against challenges.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Title: Wired Worthless Phone Users

Book: Moxyland by Lauren Beukes

Objective: To discuss a social practice in “Moxyland”, that is significant to how the reader would approach the text. Talk about how it influences how we read it and be able to make a suggestion about the significance to interpret the novel.

Social Practice: Self-absorbed human beings who rely so much on cell phones, specifically needing the best device that makes their life easier.

Bio: Moxyland is a very complex and confusing novel. It is difficult to follow at the beginning because of the different type of language the characters talk in. It is challenging because of the multiple shifts of point of views, jumping from one character to another. Despite this difficulty of understanding the text, it addresses an alarming social practice the current population lives about. Truly, it is humans’ reliance on cellular phones that shape them to be completely useless and self-absorbed beings. The recurring social practice of relying too much on technology, spark readers’ interest in our four narrators, particularly Toby who constantly seeks the use of a cell phone. The readers start to become frustrated reading because of how self centered and boastful the characters are in the novel, Toby, in particular. He only ever thinks about getting laid, getting money from Lerato, and get a hold on a phone to contact for help and entertainment. Truly, he becomes so annoying that readers begin to question who they are in this story. Evidently, a person reading this novel is intently criticized, judged by the narrator through mirroring the current practices human beings indulge in today. Indeed, it is Toby’s infuriating character that influences the readers to pause and reflect on what kind of life they are living in right now. Readers are ought to see what life would be like in the future with our reliance and wired minds on cellular devices.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[1) Title: The Realities of Modern-Virtual Day Life

2) The Realities of Modern-Virtual Day Life essay will cover many different aspects of digital culture in the 2010 era such as modern day technologies like cellphones, social media applications, and being in-tune with virtual life. It will also cover how it has affected human society so much in a way that is almost beginning to have a negative affect on society. For example, society is starting to become dependent on these technologies, and for some, have trouble going through daily life when their cellphone runs out of batteries. This is very present in Moxyland as Kendra has allowed herself to become a walking billboard for a soft drink called Ghost in exchange for enhanced strength and mental health. And now she will have an addiction to Ghost for as long as she is alive.

Two Topics:

1) How relevant the technology used in Moxyland is compared to our current generations as technology is slowly becoming more of an integrated part of our lives.

2) How technology is being pushed on us as consumers compared to how the government in Moxyland pushes everyone to live futuristically with technology.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Control Freaks
To live in Moxyland you have to give up control. Everything depends on being connected. No independence or choice on the matter, everything works via the SIM card of your phone. Disobeying the law leads to electric shock administered from said phone, leaving really no opportunity for rebellion without disconnection first. Lerato also displays the need for control in her life over her partners, her work and her life in general. When Lerato makes her move up in the company and manipulates it so she won’t have to work with her previous partner she is controlling the outcome of her future in a cold calculating way. Her detachment from emotions makes this control easier to maintain. 

This paper will dive into the topic of control within Moxyland ~ How Lerato needs control over her entire life, how living within Moxyland demands you give control to those operating your phones. How this affects the law and enforcement as well as the increased appeal of rebellion.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Title: The Not-So-Betrayed Friendship of Parzival and Aech

Bio

Wade lives in life, his real life, in the OASIS. Everything he sees, does, feels, and is all real to this protagonist. Arguably, Wade’s alternate ego Parzival has a life of his own there too. A major component in Parzival’s life, which assisted him in finding the Easter egg, was his online friendship with fellow Gunter Aech. , 
Aech is a manly man (or is he?), and has been friends with Parzival for several years prior to their commencement of the quest for The Egg. For a great lapse of time, he remained one of the top Gunters in The OASIS, which was until the IOI took over. 
Parzival and Aech shared a lot of fond memories together such as the numerous quests they helped each other to solve, as well as the intimate secrets that were told in secrecy. HOWEVER, this friendship comes to a temporary roadblock when he finds out Aech’s true identity...


Two Main Subjects
1)	How does the gender of Aech affect her friendship with Wade (how or how not)?
2)	How does Aech relate so much with Parzival through the OASIS?]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Title: A changing priority; how the quest for the golden egg became a battle of good versus evil

Thematic element :teamwork

Main Points: How the quest morphed from an individualistic pursuit of wealth and/or fame to a unified fight against the evil corporation of IOS. Initially, the character's have little interest and desire to share hints about the quest and help each other out. However, with the IOS having a powerful group of people supporting them behind the scenes, it becomes clear that teamwork is the only way to compete against them. IOS is clearly representative of evil, in what would become a battle of good versus evil. This is exemplified in their willingness to kill innocent people and do whatever is necessary to win. Reacting to this, the leading competitors, who previously do little to help each other, unite to fight their common enemy. These characters are representative of the "good" side because their intentions are noble and honest, in that they intend to use the money to help others. 

Another thing to talk about is how characters are portrayed and how some characters fulfill pre-existing beliefs we have them. For example, the Japanese character, Shoto, sacrifices the life of his avatar to help his friends get closer to completing the quest. The way he did is reminiscent of a kamikaze pilot choosing a target and sacrificing their life to help the cause. The character of Shoto is representative of a more collectivist culture, whereby the group is more important than the individual-(which is more what western culture values). The fact that he was willing to give his avatar's life demonstrate this belief, but also demonstrates the power of teamwork in this fight of good versus evil.]]></wp:comment_content>

I feel your subjects are a bit too big. I feel human dependency can be a topic for QUESTION#2. Why? It's a cultural practice I think. Is it not? I mean a lot of people struggle not to get disconnected. And even if they do get disconnected, they often don't run the risk of making their punishment of being disconnected permanent. Just a thought!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey, 
how are relationships significant? I felt like you summarized again for your topic. I feel relationships(investing time into other people in order to get sometime back) is too big of a topic. Maybe you can talk about the importance of trust the characters have with one another because of a big foe. When there's a bigger foe that no one cna take, are alliances formed. Think of alien invasions when the world makes peace with itself in order to defeat the aliens. Also, hold it cowboy. How do you really know Wade's reality is enhanced by meeting Art3mis? Sure they kiss, but it ends there. You're assuming it's enhanced. Maybe talk about the importance of people over wealth? I mean he did want to risk a lot of money for her. Again, these are just some thoughts!]]></wp:comment_content>

I like this. But only when you compare and contrast of two girls who deceive people through their appearance. Discuss outcomes, and the importance of: appearances aren't everything. UNLESS, you want to talk about gender. Then discuss the importance of the girls overcoming obstacles. E.g. Art3mis discovers the temple for the copper key before Wade.

The characters of Ready Player One take advantage of their new life by altering their appearance to fulfill their flaws, and express their true personalities without the feeling of criticism from other players. The text supports it by giving an orphan the power to mute, make friends with people who are not what they seem in real life and a chance to escape the harsh reality the orphan is in. The two elements that might cover the paper are: Identity and… nah. Just identity. Examples from Wade’s life will be used as evidence to the online world being a gateway to another life.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I like where this going, but you'll need to refine this to one character--perhaps just deal with Art3mis. You can explore the contradictions inherent in the story as you suggest, but try to get at what this means for our understanding of the novel. What does the female character's representation say about the nature of intelligence for women? Why is it represented that way? What does the book give us in the way of examples or stereotypes that might be imbedded in the reading or reception of the female character?

I would watch talking about the homosexuality only insofar as it's a separate essay. You'll need another essay on that one and one that lays out a little more clearly what you see as the stereotypes--a good example of an essay that requires strict definitions. There's a lot going on in that last sentence, particularly the assumptions it makes about the nature of homosexuality. You'll need to clear that up before you can really get at how the book represents homosexuality and why that representation might be important.]]></wp:comment_content>

What examples does the book present to help you explain or define digital culture.

Look at the last question as an example (there's no question mark, but it's a question): what does "human<strong>'</strong>s natural dependency" even mean? And what exactly are we "oblivious" too? And then finally, how are these two incoherent terms related to each other?]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Watch the formal sentence level work in here--there are a lot of errors in diction and phrasing, particularly around prepositional phrases. Make sure your ideas connect naturally, not through the use of prepositional connectors such as "indeed" and "truly," which deceive.

You might also think about what you mean by "social practice." If you just mean how people use cell phones, then just state that, getting rid of the social practice thing. Remember what we have been discussing in class: work from small THINGS into big concepts, not the other way around. So start with cell phones and show how they work in the novel and then show the reader how that is a unique kind of social practice. 

Finally, make sure there is a coherence to your ideas. The essay should "flow" because it has a unified approach or reading of the subject under discussion. If you have too many disparate subjects, like dealing with too many different aspects of one character (Toby) that are not connected clearly enough to the social practice under discussion. IN other words, how does "Toby's infuriating character" "influence" readers "to pause and reflect on the life they are living right now"? Where are you getting support for that claim? It seems to suggest that you can read the reader's minds--that you can assume the reactions of other people; that's a tall order. 

Get yourself into specific instances in the text where Toby does something that will illustrate your claims. If you cannot find such examples, then you probably don't have something there.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Instructions</strong>: <em>(Due for the April 1st class&#8211;no joke!)</em> You made it, the last module! Yay you!</p>

<p>This module asks you to cast a TV version of <em>JPod</em> and give your reasons for casting it with the actors you&#8217;ve chosen. You should watch an episode or two of the <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/player/Shows/Shows/More+Shows/jPod/">CBC series</a> to get a feel for what you might be casting. No need to follow their representational choices, but it&#8217;ll give you a guideline. You can choose any reasonably famous movie or TV star to fill out the cast, and you must cast and justify no fewer than three characters in the novel. </p>

<p><strong>Task</strong>: After first naming the character in <em>JPod</em>, suggest a movie or TV or stage actor you would cast in the role. Make sure you justify your decision for each casting choice by
<ol><li>justifying the qualities the actor might be able to portray and how these mesh with the representative qualities for the character (i.e.: he&#8217;s tall, does good geek, and is good looking)</li>
<li>suggesting how the actor will cohere with the other actors you have cast (i.e.: she and XXX look like the kind of couple I imagine XXX and XXX to be in the book)</li>
<li>ordering the three (or more) casting decisions in terms of billing and justifying their placement. So, if you cast Tom Cruise, you better be prepared to give him top billing, which might take Benedict Cumberbatch off the list because he would also deserve top billing; how will you justify hiring them both? (writing that you have an unlimited budget is not allowed!)</li></ol></p>

<p><strong>Outcomes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Thinking about how you would cast characters should get you thinking in more narrow terms about how characters interplay and interweave in a text. How there are certain qualities and characteristics that are replicated and not.</li>
<li>Be daring with your casting&#8211;is there a case where you could cast against sex for example&#8211;casting a male actor in a female role. What concepts or characteristics might this reveal in the character that you think are present in the book? Imagine Barbara in <em>The Bug</em> as played by Kanye, for instance. How would this allow us to better reveal Barbara&#8217;s predominant dispositions?</li>
<li>Narrow your focus and think seriously about what qualities you want to emphasize in your casting&#8211;doing so often reveals areas of thematic interest in the text.</li>
<li>Are you casting based qualities (similar / dissimilar) or theme (this is a novel about technology, all the actors need to be young!)? Think about the ramifications of these decisions and the way you are contextualizing things.</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[After watching one of the episodes of J pod from the CBC series, I thought they did a decent job of casting characters. The choices in actors/actresses were pretty well done but I felt like Kaitlin and John Doe could've been casted differently. Anyway, here are my choices: 

John Doe: Paul Rudd
He is perfect for this part because Paul Rudd is really good at doing nerdy roles and being an odd character. Id imagine John Doe is pretty weird due to his unusual upbringing and the fact that he chose his name to be something so generic kind of implies he is boring. Paul Rudd would go well with the others chosen because he is good at playing a laid back part and he shows how bizarre he can be in his role in “Our Idiot Brother”. He would receive top billing because he is the most popular actor, even though he isn’t the main character he would be good for playing John Doe.  
Ethan: Chris Pratt
Chris Pratt has an excellent sense of humor, is known to play sarcastic roles in TV series such as Parks and Rec and was in Guardians of the Galaxy which shows he is into sci-fi/ fantasy genres that reflect videogames. He and Aubrey Plaza are a couple in Parks and Rec and they are both hilarious and a good on screen pair so that is why I chose her to be Kaitlin. He is pretty famous as well but wouldn’t receive top pay. 
Kaitlin:  Aubrey Plaza
Perfect for playing Kaitlin who is kind of bossy, sarcastic and also intelligent. Like I mentioned above her and Chris Pratt are an excellent couple and they both would suit the relationship that exists between Kaitlin and Ethan in the novel. Aubrey Plaza is good at portraying a strong female lead in the workplace like Kaitlin does in J pod. She would go well with the other actors because of her sense of humor and quick wit. She is known well enough to get paid the same as Chris Pratt and not just for her popularity but for her talent as an actress.
Bree: Brenda Song
She is good at playing both silly and serious characters. She is also really pretty but smart so she reflects Bree's character in the novel well. I think she would make a good nerd. As far as compensation goes, since her “Suite life of Zack and Cody” days she fell off the map so really she should be grateful she is being considered and take what is offered.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[JPod was an interesting novel to say the least due to the unique characters and strange plot twists. Nonetheless, the number of random, outrageous details ultimately made the novel quite funny in my opinion. Having said that, if I were to cast actors to play the characters in JPod, I would choose the following: 
1.	Ethan’s mom, Carol Jarlewski, Jamie Lee Curtis 
She could portray the character of a pot-growing, psychotic, murderous mom in my opinion because of her appearance and fun smile, in addition to her ability to play comedic roles. 
2.	Ethan’s boss, Steve Lefkowitz, Ed Helms
He could portray the character of a slightly ‘odd’ middle-aged heroin addict going through a mid-life crisis really well in my opinion because he’s got an average looking appearance and would seem like a good fit for a man obsessing over a much older lady. 
3.	Kam Fong, Chinese mobster, Ken Jeong
He could portray the perfect combination of a person who is dangerous yet extremely weird (a gangster who ballroom dances??), much like his character in the Hangover series. 
In general, I believe all these characters will get along quite well due to their outgoing personalities and comedic abilities. Out of the three actors I chose to cast, I would say their given order is pretty accurate in terms of billing. Although all three are well-heard of, I think since Jamie Lee Curtis has more experience in the acting industry, she would get a slightly higher amount of pay. Other than that, I don’t think these actors are among the big-shot Hollywood celebrities that need a hefty compensation, that too for supporting roles.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Characters
Ethan’s Dad: Steve Carrel
I can imagine Ethan’s dad being Steve Carrel because Steve Carrel has just the right amount of weirdness and randomness to play Ethan’s Dad. Steve Carrel is the only actor that I can imagine that would be funny and also so passionate about something like ballroom dancing. Also his age range would be good for a role of a father.
Kaitlin: Emma Stone
Emma Stone generally plays comedic characters in most movies she is in, which is why I can see her being Kaitlin. Because her type of comedy would be perfect for doing that scene where Kaitlin trolls with everyone with her subway post and her stalker neighbour. And in the CBC series she was a blonde character and we have seen Emma Stone Blond as well from Spiderman when she portrayed Gwen. Furthermore, Emma stone is also in her twenties so she could fit Kaitlin’s description pretty well.
Ethan’s Boss (Steve): Chris Pine
Chris Pine played the boss’s son in Horrible Bosses 2, which is why I can see him playing the Ethan’s Boss. In the movie he played a character that would do anything for money even rob his own dad, similarly Steve was willing to whatever he could just to interact with his own children, even if it meant that it was bad for his own company or business and that all his employees were against the idea.
All the characters I have chosen tend to do similar comedies in movies, so I don’t think they will have a lot of conflict with each other. Also they would most likely not have any scenes with each other since they mostly interact with Ethan so even if there was conflict between them, it would not matter. Furthermore two of them are playing supporting roles so it should not cost them much for their roles especially for Steve as he is missing for most of the middle of the book. This way they can spend a bit more money to cast Emma Stone as Kaitlin.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Actors I would cast for jPod:

Kate Winslet as Kaitlin 
When I watch Kaitlin interacting with other jPodders, she can be very bossy, hard-working and ambitious (unlike the others who slacks and fool around at work). I see Kate Winslet playing this character because I always seen her in serious roles. For example, in her role in Mildred Pierce, she plays a hard working mother and has goals as her priority. So this role reminded me of Kaitlin wanting to leave jPod and move where she could work with more ambitious people (episode 1). Also I chose Kate Winslet as Kaitlin because they have the blonde hair and similar age (I checked the actress who played Kaitlin). I think Kate deserve top billing because she is famous for laying many successful movies.

Ian Somerhalder as Cancer Cowboy
I chose Ian (the guy who played Damon Salvatore in the Vampire Diaries, which is a TV show) because his character is laid-back, more in the first season. The first episode of jPod, Cowboy described that he started smoking because it was cool, even his parents warned him not to smoke. So this tells me that Cowboy is doing whatever pleases him. He is not really productive during work (recording with camera, chilling with other jpodders). This unmotivated character reminds me of Damon because he loves to chill and also murderous. The fact that Cowboy has an obsession with death, Ian who played a killer would be a plus.

Michael Cera as John Doe
When I think of Michael Cera, I always picture him playing the same type of character: awkward, shy and nerdy. Take for example, superbad, arrested development and Scott Pilgrim. Since John Doe is different because he grew up in a lesbian commune, never tried soda, no television and at the same time, tries to act “normal”, I think Cera could play John Doe. As for appearance, Cera does have a nerdy look to him and so does the actor who played John Doe. I placed Cera last because his character is not the most important character and also Cera is not as famous as the two above.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Jpod was an enjoyable novel to read but it was interesting to see how the characters were portrayed on tv. The show on CBC was quite humorous and light-hearted to watch. The characters in the television series were acted out very well but there are a few other actors who would perfectly play the role of Ethan, Carol and Cancer Cowboy.

Ethan Jarlewski: Jonah Hill

I think Jonah would play the part of Ethan very well. I can just see the character of Carol calling Jonah to bail her out of a problem which leads to a humorous outcome. In my opinion, he also looks like he would be good at portraying a computer programmer or someone working for a video game company. In most of Jonah’s movies, he depicts an outgoing personality who gets along with everyone. This is similar to Ethan’s character in JPod. These indications suggest he would fit the perfect profile as Ethan Jarlewski.

Carol Jarlewski: Katey Sagal

Katey would be a great fit to play Carol. Katey also plays the mother of the protagonist on Sons of Anarchy and her character strongly resembles Carol Jarlewski. In the show, she is at times involved in illegal activities for the motorcycle club. Carol runs a marijuana grow-op in JPod. They both have accidently killed someone and both are portrayed as a loving mother towards their children. Katey is also a very attractive female and she could play the character Steve falls in love with.

Cancer Cowboy: Bobby Cannavale 

I can see Bobby portray the character of Cancer Cowboy. He has been in many tv shows and movies portraying a comedic personality. In JPod, Cancer Cowboy is a humorous character who is also addicted to sex. Bobby’s character in Boardwalk Empire depicts a hot headed gangster who enjoys auto-erotic asphyxiation in the form applied by a belt to his neck. He enjoys this form of pleasure rather than having sex with women. In Boardwalk Empire, it is quite humorous seeing a women try to strangle him in this fashion. His character was very enjoyable to watch and he would be a great fit to portray Cancer Cowboy.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Ethan: John Krasinski
I think John Krasinski would be a great choice for the role of Ethan. Ethan’s is a character who is both smart and uses sarcasm for most of his humour. He reminds me of John Krasinski when he played Jim in The Office as a young sales rep who was very sarcastic and funny in pranking his fellow coworker Dwight Schrute. He also has a caring soft side to him just like Ethan as we see he helps others such as his mom. John would be the lowest of the three on the billing list of the actors behind Jennifer Lawrence.

Kaitlin: Jennifer Lawrnce 
Jennifer Lawrence would be a great fit for the role of Kaitlin. As we see with Hunger Games Jennifer can play the hard working role, stubborn character and I think she would be a great fit with John as they would match well together and eventually show interest each other and date as seen later in Jpod. The only part she would have to change her usual acting is with Kaitlin’s perkiness personality at times but I’m sure Jennifer would be able to adjust to this role. Jennifer would be the second highest on the billing list behind Sandra Bullock.

Carol: Sandra Bullock
I think would be an excellent fit for the role of Ethan’s mother Carol. She can play the sexy, sneaky badass mom kind of role. Her role in The Blind Side is the type of character I see her playing in this show in how she can be uptight and bossy. She fits well with John playing Ethan I believe and I could see them working well together in the close caring mother and son relationship. Sandra would be the highest on the billing list and realistically be very tough to get her on this type of show.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Andrew Garfield as Ethan Jarlewski

I think Andrew could portray Ethan quite well in the sense that Ethan is intelligent and creative. Andrew Garfield has played various roles, the most popular being Spider-Man in the latest film. He has a witty personality and often brings out his sarcastic, goofy side which I think fits perfectly for the character of Ethan.

Meryl Streep as Ethan's mother

Ethan's mother has a very distinct personality, and vibe to her that is given off in the book. From the grow op in her basement, to experimenting with women she is kind of unpredictable. She is badass yet very infatuating and Meryl can and has played so many different roles that she could easily adapt into the very different phases Ethan's mother goes through naturally.

Amanda Seyfried as Ellen Kovacs (Ethan's dad's young girlfriend) 

I feel she would play the role of the young, ditzy girlfriend quite well. The blonde, blue eyed beauty working on a set fits perfectly. Having a strange, inappropriate? relationship with Ethan's much older father is something I can picture Amanda doing. There's no knowing the true intentions behind the relationship itself but one can have all types of assumptions. The part in the novel where she got high from "The Dude" plays into the role of her being a young, irresponsible woman. 

As for the billing, Meryl Streep would get top billing as she is the most established of the bunch as an actress. Then Andrew Garfield, being the main character and all. And lastly, Amanda Seyfried as she has a smaller role and isn't as popular or well known as the other two.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[After watching the first two episodes of JPOD, I must say it was very annoying to watch and the acting seemed very fake to me. Enough of my negativity, if I were to cast actors and actresses to play characters in JPOD I would choose the following;

1. Ethan’s Dad: Jim Carrey
Ethan’s father is portrayed as this immature, young at heart grandpa age man. He  does not take responsibility for his actions and allows his son, Ethan to take the blame for his mistakes. Ethan’s father that does not act as a father figure to Ethan, instead a buddy who has no self control. The actor that I can guarantee 100% would nail this role would be Jim Carrey. Jim is known for his flexible facial expressions and the spunky attitude that brings life to the roles he plays. Jim, would be able to carry the role of Ethan’s father with his various animated voices and extravert personality that allows him to act immature and 16 year old stuck in a 60 year old body.

2. Ethan’s Boss, Steve Lefkowitz: Vince Voughan
Steve Lefkowitz is a middle age man who is going through a life crisis where he just got out of an ugly divorce and has zero custody of his son from his failed marriage. Steve is willing to sacrifice his own company in order to have some form of interaction with his son. His character is self centred, exciting, positive and a pushy boss. Vince Voughan would be perfect for the role where he is seen as intimidating with his towering height and on top of that having a sardonic sense of humor. Vince has the personality of being optimistic, enthusiastic, creative being a visionary. His character traits fit the role as Steve pushing the team to “think outside of the box.” 

3. Kaitlin: Anna Kendrick
Kaitlin is the newest member of JPOD, who is very goal driven, bossy, and is intelligent. Kaitlin is a suck up to the Steve and wants to succeed. Anna Kendrick would do a phenomenal job portraying Kaitlin. She would do well because of her outgoing, strong personality, and sarcastic sense of humor. She would do well sucking up to her boss Steve aka Vince Voughan who would take little notice of her.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[After watching a few episodes of the JPod series on CBC I thought they did a pretty good job of casting the characters. However, I personally would’ve changed the roles of, John Doe, Carol Ethan’s mom, Bree Jyang, and Cancer Cowboy.

Ian Somerhalder as Cancer Cowboy
Lets just start off by stating the facts; Ian Somerhalder is one sexy looking guy. Ian plays the role of Damon Salvatore in Vampire Diaries. His character is just a ruthless, “I don’t give a damn about anything or anyone” type of guy. Ian would be able to bring the smart alec, witty, rebellious, traits for the role but also make it clear that he’s very justified in what he’s doing. 

Adam Brody as John Doe 
After watching the first episode of the JPod series I thought Adam Brody would be the perfect fit. In Brody’s previous projects (starred in the hit series “The O.C”) he played Seth Cohen. He plays the unpopular, nerdy, non-athletic type of guy, who’s afraid to be around girls let alone talk to them. I’ve seen a few movies/series that Brody has done, he can play that nerdy, shy, smart, character and portray John Doe perfectly.

Leighton Meester as Bree Jyang
Leighton Meester used to play “Blair” in the series Gossip Girl. She was the popular girl, known as “queen B”. Just as Bree, she has severe control issues, defiantly a perfectionist. She was raised in a family that had extremely high standards for her. Bree is emotions capture expert meaning, she takes “perfect moments and imprisons them on her hard drive for ever and ever”.  Meester plays roles that are confident and sexy, in pervious roles she intimidates men, I think she would be able to portray the role in a very confident, snarky, witty way. She would find her inner Blair to play the role of Bree.

Laura Dern as Ethan’s Mom Carol
I chose Laura Dern to play the role of Ethan’s mom because to me she has that hippie, happy-go-lucky type of personality. Plus she reminded me of the actress who played Ethan’s mom in the TV series. I’ve researched some of the work Dern has done and she’s able to play the funny, silly, but serious and heart-aching roles so I think for the type of story line she can both be serious and humorous. 

As far as billing I would probably list them as, Ian Somerhalder, Adam Brody, Leighton Meester, then Laura Dern as last just because I think there are a lot of “TV moms” you can chose from that could easily play the role.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Ethan: Andy Samberg
	Andy would be a great cast for Ethan because he has experience being a sarcastic geek. Andy’s role in Brooklyn 99, he was a really good cop that was also a rebel against authority. The reflex Ethan’s personality at work because he is always trying to do anything but work. Andy’s appearance also reflects what I imagined Ethan to looks like. He isn’t some super model and he has some uniqueness to his appearance.

Kaitlin: Hayden Panettiere
	Hayden would play Kaitlin very well because she can play a stuck of female that keeps to herself. Hayden can play a very self-supporting character just like Kaitlin and I think she can also be sarcastic. Andy and Hayden would also look good together as a couple and Hayden seems like the character that needs to be chased to get. Hayden has the personality and appearance that I expected Kaitlin to have because she holds herself like she is better than others.

Ethan’s Mom: Patricia Clarkson
	Patricia would be an excellent cast for Ethan’s mom because she is very quirky. Patricia’s role in Easy A is very similar to what I think Ethan’s mom is like because she is very free minded and loving. Patricia’s appearance is not what I expected from Ethan’s mom but her personality makes up for that.

	These actors will work together very well because they all have very sarcastic personalities. I honestly have no idea how to pay these guys cause I have no interest in the movie business. I don’t know who would get paid what because I don’t know who is a better actor.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Jim Jarlewski: For the character of Ethan’s father Jim Jarlewski I would cast Will Ferrell. Will Ferrell is hilarious and odd which portrays the Jim Jarlewski character. I believe Will Ferrell could be that father who is immature but who could also show a little bit of emotion in a humorous way.

Cancer Cowboy: For the character of Cancer Cowboy I would cast Rob Corddry. Rob Corddry played “Lou” in the movie Hot tub time machine where he played a suicidal party animal who was laid back and a big fan of women. Just like Cowboy who's character who's a confident, womanizing, laid back guy who eventually becomes obsessed with death.  I also think Rob Corddry would be awesome because of his physical appearance isn't what you would expect for Cowboy’s character.
 
Kaitlin Joyce: For Kaitlins character I would cast Cameron Diaz. Cameron Diaz is usually playing a perky and charming blonde in her movie roles and would great for the character of Kaitlin. Kaitlin plays a smart blonde girl who is a bit of a keener and tries to further her career. I think Cameron Diaz could play that role perfectly but also had some flavour to the character, if that makes sense.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Steven (The Boss) played by Will Ferrell
Steven comes across as a goofy and sarcastic person who is always making weird faces and sometime even weird hand gestures. Will Ferrell would be perfect for this part because he plays a goofy character in all of his movies and could easily pass for a weird boss. Both Steven and Will Ferrell often act like they are a bit full of themselves.

Ethan played by Darin Brooks
Ethan reminds me of Darin Brooks from the tv show, Blue Mountain State. He is a laid back guys who seems to go with the flow. I also noticed a lot of similar facial expressions between Ethan and Darin Brooks, such as their smug grin, or the face they make when they are embarrassed.

Cancer Cowboy played by Sean William Scott
Sean William Scott, more commonly known as Stifler from the American Pie movies, would be the best fit to play the part of Cancer Cowboy. Cancer Cowboy acts overconfident and cocky with a sense of humour and perhaps a sex addiction. In American Pie, Sean William Scott had all of those qualities, and the two find themselves similarly up to no good.

Bree played by Julie Bowen
Julie Bowen plays Claire Dunphy on the tv show Modern Family. She resembles Bree because they are both high maintenance people who strive for perfectionism, however they both have a wild side which one may not expect after a first impression.

I believe these actors would have excellent chemistry together because they would all greatly reenact the elements of humour in this show, which there is a lot of. Even though these four actors have their own levels of fame, they are all extremely talented and would be right for their respective roles in Jpod. They would combine for a manageable budget that would likely receive critical acclaim from viewers.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Ethan’s Dad, Jim Jarlewski played by Dustin Hoffman
To me, Dustin Hoffman gives off a very youthful spirit in many characters, especially as Bernie Focker in Meet the Fockers, which is why I would cast him as Jim. Both Jim and Dustin are feisty gentlemen, who seem less technologically inclined and more interested in having an affair with a much younger woman and watching Law &amp; Order, if there is enough time in the day. Dusty can really turn on the flare and fun in characters, while portraying a serious tone too. 

I think Dustin would fit perfectly with Jane Fonda as Jim and Carol. The two are equally respected in film for their energy, versatility and raw talent. Dustin and Jane are also the same age so they seem like a fitting couple to be married and play parents of adult children.

Ethan’s Mom, Carol Jarlewski played by Jane Fonda
Jane Fonda is such a lively woman with a lot of attitude and strong values. Jane could easily switch between the multiple facets of the loving mother, wife, ‘gardener’, and accidental murderer. I think she could bring out the dimension of Carol that is determined to do her own ‘thing’, especially when Carol runs off to the lesbian commune.

Aside from her perfect dynamic with Dusty, I think Jane would bring a hilariously sarcastic dimension to her opening scene with Ethan when the two are driving around to find a grave for Tim the biker.

John Doe played by Nicholas Hoult
Nicholas Hoult’s tall, lankier figure strikes me as geeky which seems like it might suit the character of John Doe. Nicholas is a young man in film who has a story behind the spotlight, just like John. He seems like the introverted and knowledgable type who takes a genuine interest in technology and creating.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Ethan's mom Carol  Jarlewski - Lena Headey.

Lena Headey's performances in Dredd and Game of Thrones show that she is well rounded in being able to play as a loving mother - as-well as a killer. Lena Headey's character Cersei Lannister in Game of Thrones was more cynical than Carol, but her ability to combine those elements is why I chose her. 

- In terms of Billing, Lena would probably cost the most.


John Doe - Micheal Cera
Micheal Cera played the perfect 'typical freshman' in Superbad. Despite his ability to play the 'typical' he has a quirky, and odd nature to his acting aswell. In both Superbad and Youth in revolt, he played as a socially awkward teenager. John Doe had a crazy upbringing from a mother who bragged about not shaving her arm-pits, and micheal cera captures that "I'm trying to be normal but in reality..." aura that John Doe had while I was reading the book.

-Micheal cera is 2nd in terms of billing. I'm not sure on his popularity compared to Lena Headey, but I think Lena is the better actor anyways. Lena is more diverse in her acting ability, Micheal Cera is not.

-I think the akwardness of Micheal Cera - and the 60s-70s lighthearted innuendos of Mike Myers would be entertaining to watch, because these two actors are so vastly different in the characters they can accurately portray.

Cancer Cowboy - Mike Myers (As Austin Powers)
The Cancer Cowboy in the CBC version looks like a normal guy besides him walking around shirtless/opened button shirt. Mike Myer's character Austin Powers constantly made sexual innuendos throughout the film - similar to Cancer Cowboy. However I think Cancer Cowboy's actor has too serious of a mood when it comes to his personality, Mike Myers would be able to actually play his character while being funny at the same time. 

- However for billing, Mike Myers would be at the bottom.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[JPOD cast

Ethan Jarlewski :Jesse Eisenberg

He would be a good fit for a number of reasons. First of all, he has played in other roles where his parents were dysfunctional and his family life is a burden on him. Also, he has played roles where he is socially akyward and in a geek type role. Lastly, he would be much younger that those playing his parents, which helps to illustrate why his parents are so out of touch with him and his life.

Carol Jarlewski : Cathy Bates

Cathy Bates would be have top billing. Her past performance in the movie 'Misery', whereby she played a sadistic, tough as nails woman make her an obvious choice for the role of Carol. Also, her versatility in the many roles she has done make her an smart choice as well.

Jim Jarlewski: Bryan Cranston
Bryan Cranston is a good enough actor that he could actually play someone who has no acting ability, as was the case for Jim's character in the book. He would have second billing. Also, his role in Breaking Bad in a way parallels the role of Jim in the book, whereby both roles involved trying to be something other than themselves (i.e the chemistry teacher turned drug lord and the wannabe actor constantly acting out different scenarios-with little success of course).Also, Bryan Cranston's ability to act out being intoxicated (while representing the character of Walter White) would do well to represent Jim's heavy drinking in the latter half of the book.

How would they interact? I believe they would have a mutual respect for each other's acting ability, and also respect the billing decisions expressed-since it goes by seniority essentially, giving most credit and pay to the age/experience of each actor/actress.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Anne Hathaway as Kaitlin
Kaitlin has a very controlling personality. She is a great leader and motivates the JPod crew meet their goals. Anne Hathaway appears in many movies in this type of role including Get Smart, Love &amp; Other Drugs, and Interstellar. I feel that Anne deserves to be paid well because she is so well known but not as well known as Adam Stadler. 

Chris Pine as Ethan
One of the main reasons I chose Chris to play the part of Ethan in JPod is because him and Anne Hathaway work so well together. They are the kind of couple that I envisioned in JPod. He also has a relaxed personality and would be able to withstand a crazy family and a difficult work life. He would be able to overcome burying the biker as well as both his parents having an affair. Recently, Chris has had leads in several action packed movies including Star Trek which is also filled with many technological advances and innovations. He would certainly have the knowledge to work out the flaws of a gaming system. 

Adam Sandler as Ethan's dad
Adam would play the role of Ethan's dad perfectly since he has a lot of experience and has been a fatherly figure in several movies. He is very funny and most of the movies he is in are comedies. Ethan's dad is a very quirky character and very spontaneous so Adam definitely fits the part. Although he is very well know, he will not be the top paid actor in this film because he is not the main character. Since he is constantly in the spot light in films every year, he would be the second top paid actor. 

Tina Fey as Bree
Tina would be a great actor to play the part of Bree. Her character in Baby Mamma had uptight and bossy attitude. She also had a determined attitude in with Bree also shows. As well as their rule following personalities, both Fey and Bree can also come across as very adventurous and mischievous. Fey shows off this side in movies such as date night.

Although these four actors are all well known, not all of them have an equal amount of screen time or lines. Chris does not have as much experience and wisdom in the acting world as Adam does and thus, Adam will be paid the most out of the four. Anne Hathaway will be paid the third top and Tina will be the least paid out of the four since her character does not change throughout the movie and she has less of an entertaining role.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Robbie Amell, I feel would fit the character of Ethan. He portrays characters that have a busy life style and plays characters well in settings where there is a lot of conflict but can make it humourist and deal with it well. Http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2064412/?ref_=nmbio_trv_2

Gina Rodriguez, I feel would play Kartina well. She is able to handle roles where the character is a bit crazy because of things that are occurring in the characters life. http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1752221/?ref_=tt_cl_t1 

Michael Grant Terry I feel would play cancer cowboy. Because he has a southern like personality in the television shows I have seen while also playing a tech savvy and creative character. When first reading Cancer Cowboys character I immediately pictured this actor.  http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2163204/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t9

Robbie Amell would get top billing because he is the main character and then Gina Rodriguez and lastly Michael Grant Terry. I feel these actors would correspond well with each other and make the show serious but add the physical written humour that is present in the text.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[1.	Katherine Heigl as Kaitlin Joyce. Katherine is a tall, strong, blonde female actress, and was almost too pretty when I decided to pick her for Ethan’s character. I chose her anyways because her character portrayals embody somebody eager to learn and prove themselves, and someone who won’t stop until she achieves her dreams. 


2.	Zach Braff as Ethan Jarlewski. With Zach Braff’s charm and boyish good looks, I think he makes the perfect candidate for our less-than-perfect jPodder. Based on the Ethan Jarlewski from the TV series jPod, Zach Braff and him share similar characteristics; are tall, brunette, lanky, and slightly awkward. Zach Braff’s love life as portrayed by characters he’s played has never been smooth sailing, and it often takes a lot of courage for him to work up the guts and make the first move. 


3.	Jason Biggs as Steve Lefkowitz. I chose this pairing because although the character normally portrayed by Jason Biggs means good, and is an overall good person, the viewer just loves to hate him (or at least I do). Biggs’ short-lived stint on the new Netflix series “Orange is the New Black” proves that the character he played was so undesirable it got removed from the show at the end of the second season. He will ultimately be getting paid the least since after the American Pie movies his career never quite took off. He’s a generic flat character that generally does not have much to offer for other.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Ethan J- Robert Downy Jr.
Ethan is seen as the "main guy" in the show since the camera is almost always pointed at him. I see Ethan as a critical thinker and intelligent. Robert Downy often plays a similar role and has a personality that is serious, critical thinker, and often portrayed as a heroic figure. The moment I figured out who Ethan was in the show, Robert Downy was the very first actor that got me reminded of him because he has an intelligent look and knowledgeable in computers.

Steve- Bryan Cranston- Bryan Cranston
Steve is overly optimistic and self-absorbed. In the show, he acts as the commander in chief, but in a funny way. There is a conflicting character roles in my mind when I think of Bryan Cranston as he does both acting in comedy-type movies and serious-type movies. I've seen Bryan Cranston in military roles and I can never take him seriously, just like Steve. So putting Robert Downy and Bryan Cranston together could be an interesting mix because basing on the character types of these two actors, they would just annoy each other, which works well since Ethan doesn't really like Steve.

Cancer Cowboy- Rowan Atkinson
Cancer boy is always goofing around in the movie doing sillly things like in Episode 1 when he is half naked. Cancer boy is the comedian in the J-pod floor and that's why I've chosen Rowan Atkinson. It's such an interesting concept to think. Rowan in Mr. Bean does a lot of funny stupid things, just like the role of Cancer Cowboy.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Ethan: Patrick J Adams

I chose Patrick as an appropriate actor to play Ethan because Patrick is well known for his performance as a star on the TV series Suits. Patrick plays the intelligent and witty character extremely well and would be a perfect fit for the similar character Ethan in J-pod. Similar to Ethan, Patrick's most famous performances includes a flirty relationship with a co-worker and charming personality. As a result of Patrick's experience in a similar character role, he would be the best fit for Ethan's character. 

Carol: Elizabeth Mitchel

Although I feel as if the mother on the TV series J-pod was casted quite well, I could also see Elizabeth Mitchel taking on this role and making a better performance. Elizabeth Mitchel plays a variety of different characters in films, however, I find that she performs best in a motherly role. The mother in J-pod is not going to win mother of the year, but I could definitely see Elizabeth Mitchel taking on the role and enhancing the attractive and sneaky side to Carol's character.

Jim: Alec Baldwin

Alec Baldwin is well known for his lazy, sloppy character roles. I have not seen many movies where his character has his act together. His characters are usually chasing after women, much like Ethan's fathers in J-pod. Jim was found early on in the TV series cheating with one of Ethan's former classmates. Alec Baldwin enhance the deceitful and woman focused characteristics of Ethan's father.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Carol Jarlewski - Angelica Houston. A mix between the Adams Family and Life Aquatic. She's someone I could see being a somewhat awkward mother, but totally badass when she has to be. (I also like the idea of Jamie Lee Curtis that someone else mentioned for Carol)

Mr. Jarlewski - Jason Alexander. He's really good at the awkward characters. I can definitely see a marriage between him and Angelica being nice at the beginning but eventually they become bored with eachother and start pursuing other romances, and even though Jason is a funny guy, I could see him as an unsuccessful wanna-be actor with a younger lover. 

Greg Jarlewski - James Franco. He would be great as a brother with questionable contacts in the mob and working real-estate on the west-coast. Not to mention being a little bit of a momma's boy with Angelica Houston as Mrs. Jarlewski.

Ethan Jarlewski - who else but Dave Franco would be able to play a better brother to Greg Jarlewski? He would need to be de-handsomed/geeked-up, but Ethan isn't a boring type of guy, and Dave Franco would be able to rock refugee chic.

Breanna "Bree" Jyang - I'm torn between Keiko Agena (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiko_Agena Lane Kim in the Gilmore Girls) or Emy Coligado (Francis' wife Piama in Malcom in the Middle http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiko_Agena)
Both would be good at portraying a strong geek girl with a raunchy sense of humor and a sort of asian Bettie Page look.

Steve the guy "who turned around Toblerone in 2 years" should be cast with John Krasinski (from the Office). Kind of a sell-out corporate guy, old enough to have a kid he would get an idea like a turtle from, and I could see him becoming smitten with Carol Jarlewski in a little bit of a cougar way. 

Casper "Cancer Cowboy" Jesperson- Seth Rogan. He's great at the sarcastic humor and supporting characters, I'm thinking "Freaks and Geeks" Seth, not necessarily stoner Seth. Casper is described of as being a fan of the Duff Beer dude from the Simpsons, someone who values the macho asthetic, but has a sense of humor about it.  

I think that Alison Brie would be an amazing Kaitlin. She's really adept at playing the uptight high-achiever with an addictive past. (food in JPod vs drugs in Community). She would also have a lot of great back-and-forth between the other comedy geniuses in this cast. 

I definitely was going for an ensemble comedy-centric casting, and I would enjoy seeing these actors interact if by some miracle it was possible to get them together for a project.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Brianna Jyang : Kat Dennings

Bree Jyang is a very strong willed character who exudes of sex appeal and wit. And Kat Dennings is the best actress to play Bree’s character. Dennings has played a lot of funny characters in films and tv series and I think that this character just embodies Denning's character in one of her show. Bree’s character is similar to who Dennings is in her comedy tv series, ‘Two Broke Girls’. Bree loves how she looks, confident with her body, and quick witted. Similarly, these characteristics are exactly what Dennings pulls off in her show and will then bring justice to one of the funniest characters in Jpod. She is a great actress and would not have a hard time channelling her inner Bree Jyang side.

Casper Jesperson: Mark Salling

Mark Salling is famous for his ‘bad boy’ role in the long running tv series, ‘Glee’. And to cast him as Casper Jesperson, aka Cancer Cowboy brings out Cowboy’s cocky character higher up its threshold. Salling is able to play cocky-arrogant and sensible-likable personalities in one character as evidenced in the tv show he is on. For Salling to be able to play this comedic series would be a breeze with his bagged up charm and comedic timing. Thus, he could definitely bring up a sensitive side that Cowboy can sometimes give off when he talks.

Ethan Jarlewski: Jean-Luc Bilodeau

Jean-Luc Bilodeau just brings out that right amount of nerdy look yet still good looking character whenever I watch ‘Baby Daddy’, a comedic tv series he stars on. He is one of the lead actors in this series, and is totally hilarious and can play the gentleman like attitude he shows to the ladies he interacts with in the show. He will play Ethan Jarwelski really well with how he can act or show his care for the people around him similar to his character in the comedy show.

Ultimately, these three actors would be of sufficient budget to cast since they are not top-billed actors, or in demand with films. To put them all in one casting fit since they all have backgrounds and experiences on comedy and with how things work in tv series. Although they are not top- billed, they are amazing at what they do and could express a different side to every character as opposed to how it was originally in the series.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Cancer Cowboy: Charlie Sheen:
He has played (and lived) such a bad boy - funny - womanizer mashup of roles that I believe her would fit perfectly into the role of cancer cowboy, comparative to the actor in the TV show whom doesn't really leave an impression as well as Sheen would (in my opinion) in this role.

Ethans Mom: Sigourney Weaver:
Her role in Holes made me immediately want to cast her as Carol Jarlewski for her ability to portray the stoner momma in the show. She can play tough characters and mother-like figures all at the same time. Perfect.

Ethans Dad: Dustin Hoffman:
I cast him alongside Sigourney as Ethan's parents because I believe the two would create an interesting dynamic as parents on the show. His ability to be energetic and youthful (even if he isn't) fits the bill for Jim.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I watched the first episode of jPod before casting these actors in these roles. Anyways, here they are:

1) Ethan Jarlewski: David Henrie

I chose David Henrie for the role of Ethan Jarlewski because Ethan was portrayed as the more sensitive one in the TV show, as he was trying to comfort Kaitlin after the others found out about her past and made her feel uncomfortable. He is also shown to be very geeky as well, and I feel that David Henrie would be a very popular choice for Ethan simply because his character portrayal of "Justin Russo" in Wizards of Waverly Place was also very sensitive and seen to be very smart, as well. 

2) Kaitlin Joyce: Summer Glau

Kaitlin Joyce is portrayed as the girl-next-door type. She is extremely pretty and looks like she should be very popular, but she isn't at all in jPod and she is also shown to be quite shy. I think Summer Glau would be a perfect fit for Kaitlin because in real life, Summer seems to be quite shy and soft-spoken from interviews I have seen. Also, the characters she has portrayed in the past have often been smart characters who like to keep to themselves, a little bit like an introvert. So, I think Summer is the perfect choice for Kaitlin if a recasting was required.

3) Bree Jyang: Piper Curda

Bree Jyang is shown to be outgoing, likes to hang out with the boys, and isn't afraid to voice her opinions due to her outgoing personality. I think Piper Curda would be an excellent fit for Bree because I have seen her in other shows such as "A.N.T. Farm" and "I Didn't Do It," and she shows an incredible range of acting, able to play characters that are smart and stuck-up to characters (A.N.T. Farm) that are totally dumb and only care about fashion (I Didn't Do It). Bree is shown to be a tomboy who also likes fashion. So, I think playing Bree would be a good challenge for Piper, but I think she could totally pull it off.

4) Carol Jarlewski: Elizabeth Mitchell

From what I have seen in the first episode of jPod, Carol seems to be a very sweet mother who also harbours a dark side after she accidentally kills Tom because of a deal gone bad, and also from keeping this secret from her husband, Jim Jarlewski. Sherry Miller does a fantastic job of portraying Carol, and the other other person that I could do Carol justice is Elizabeth Mitchell. I have seen her in Revolution and Lost, and she is plays "sweet and kind" very well in both series. She is also wonderful at playing a character who harbours dark secrets on the inside, but on the outside, seems very sweet and innocent (cough cough, Juilet in Lost, cough cough). She also looks the part of Carol, as Carol seems to be portrayed as a mother who is a little older, but still very attractive, and gets some of the younger guys' attentions.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Amanda Bynes as Kaitlin Joyce: I chose Amanda as because Kaitlin is a very charming and bubbly girl who is sarcastic but is also goal orientated. Amanda Bynes always play eager and light hearted girls in her movies (Syndey White, What a girl wants) and portrays them in a comedic way, her acting can benefit and bring Kaitlin to life. Amanda typically chooses characters who are sweet but have a bit of fire in them, that's why I think the Amanda can nail the portrayal. Plus, Amanda has been out of work for a while, it would be nice for her to start her career again! 

Holland Taylor  as Carol: Holland is known for her role on "How I met you mother" as an overbearing mother, she is mischievous and is always up to something. Holland's portrayal would be perfect because she is great at acting out motives has many secrets as she is involved in many activities her sons do not know. Carol is no walk in the park, she's not an average wife who cleans all day, she is also not as innocent as she seems. 

Frankie Muniz as Ethan: Frankie Muniz does very impressive portrayals of awkward but intelligent people. His portrayal of Malcom includes trying to stay away from his dysfunctional family in "Malcom in the Middle " .]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[First of all: I want an Owen Wilson-Ben Stiller collab. So i’ll cast:

Taylor Swift as: Kaitlin. Swift would be in the show for just boosting ratings. Her popularity would influence the popularity of the show, because who doesn’t know Swift? But I feel she would portray Kaitlin’s personalities well if she acted her self. From what I know, Swift can be flexible in her personalities—many of which can be bossy or sarcastic.

Ben Stiller as Ethan’s mom: I see Ben Stiller in the marijuana business behind the scenes. I also see him as someone who always messes up. For instance, he might kill someone. I don’t care if he’s male, I will hire makeup artist to feminize him. I feel his characteristics can portray Ethan’s mom, as well as a good collab with Wilson

Owen Wilson as Ethan: I just want him to have a one-to-one moment with Stiller. I want him to have a disappointed face when he bails Stiller out of jail. I want him to have a scene in the rain while they both cry. Wilson has a sort of serious, but humorous ambiance around him.

The casting is in order from highest-lowest paid because of the popularity each actor/actress obtains.]]></wp:comment_content>
